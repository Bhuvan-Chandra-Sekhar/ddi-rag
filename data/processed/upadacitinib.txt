7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors : See the Full Prescribing Information for dosage modification for patients with atopic dermatitis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn’s disease. ( 2.13 , 7.1 ) Strong CYP3A4 Inducers : Coadministration of RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ with strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Upadacitinib exposure is increased when it is co-administered with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (such as ketoconazole, clarithromycin, and grapefruit), which may increase the risk of adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Monitor patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, non-radiographic axial spondylarthritis, pJIA, or giant cell arteritis closely for adverse reactions when co-administering RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. Food or drink containing grapefruit should be avoided during treatment with RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ. For patients with atopic dermatitis, coadministration of RINVOQ 30 mg once daily with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is not recommended. For patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, reduce the RINVOQ induction dosage to 30 mg once daily. The recommended maintenance dosage is 15 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.13 )] . 7.2 Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Upadacitinib exposure is decreased when it is co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inducers (such as rifampin), which may lead to reduced therapeutic effect [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Coadministration of RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ with strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended.
