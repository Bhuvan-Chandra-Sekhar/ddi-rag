Drug: maraviroc

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Coadministration with CYP3A inhibitors, including protease inhibitors (except tipranavir/ritonavir), will increase the concentration of maraviroc. ( 7.1 ) • Coadministration with CYP3A inducers, including efavirenz, may decrease the concentration of maraviroc. ( 7.1 ) • Coadministration with St. John’s wort is not recommended. ( 7.1 ). 7.1 Effect of Concomitant Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Maraviroc Maraviroc is metabolized by CYP3A and is also a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1, and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP)2. The pharmacokinetics of maraviroc are likely to be modulated by inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A and P-gp and may be modulated by inhibitors of OATP1B1 and MRP2. Therefore, a dosage adjustment may be required when maraviroc is coadministered with those drugs [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 , 2.4 ) ]. Concomitant use of maraviroc and St. John's wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) or products containing St. John's wort is not recommended. Coadministration of maraviroc with St. John's wort is expected to substantially decrease maraviroc concentrations and may result in suboptimal levels of maraviroc and lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to maraviroc. Additional drug interaction information is available [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ].
