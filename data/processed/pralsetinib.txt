7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors and/or P-gp inhibitors : Avoid coadministration. If coadministration cannot be avoided, reduce the dose of GAVRETO. ( 2.4 , 7.1 , 12.3 ) Strong or moderate CYP3A inducers : Avoid coadministration. If coadministration cannot be avoided, increase the dose of GAVRETO. ( 2.5 , 7.1 , 12.3 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on GAVRETO Strong or Moderate CYP3A and/or P-gp Inhibitors Concomitant use with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor and/or a P-gp inhibitor increases pralsetinib exposure [ Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , which may increase the risk of adverse reactions related to GAVRETO. Avoid coadministration of GAVRETO with a strong or moderate CYP3A and/or P-gp inhibitor. If coadministration with any of the above inhibitors cannot be avoided, reduce the GAVRETO dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Strong or Moderate CYP3A Inducers Concomitant use with a strong CYP3A inducer decreases pralsetinib exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], which may decrease efficacy of GAVRETO. Avoid concomitant use of GAVRETO with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers. If coadministration of GAVRETO with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers cannot be avoided, increase the GAVRETO dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]
