Drug: glycerol_phenylbutyrate

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Corticosteroids, valproic acid, or haloperidol : May increase plasma ammonia level; monitor ammonia levels closely. ( 7.1 ) Probenecid : May affect renal excretion of metabolites of glycerol phenylbutyrate, including phenylacetylglutamine (PAGN) and PAA. ( 7.2 ) CYP3A4 Substrates with narrow therapeutic index (e.g., alfentanil, quinidine, cyclosporine) : Glycerol phenylbutyrate may decrease exposure; monitor for decreased efficacy of the narrow therapeutic index drug ( 7.3 ) Midazolam : Decreased exposure; monitor for suboptimal effect of midazolam.( 7.3 ) 7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Ammonia Corticosteroids Use of corticosteroids may cause the breakdown of body protein and increase plasma ammonia levels. Monitor ammonia levels closely when corticosteroids and glycerol phenylbutyrate are used concomitantly. Valproic Acid and Haloperidol Hyperammonemia may be induced by haloperidol and by valproic acid. Monitor ammonia levels closely when use of valproic acid or haloperidol is necessary in patients with UCDs. 7.2 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Glycerol Phenylbutyrate Probenecid Probenecid may inhibit the renal excretion of metabolites of glycerol phenylbutyrate including PAGN and PAA. 7.3 Potential for Glycerol Phenylbutyrate to Affect Other Drugs Drugs with narrow therapeutic index that are substrates of CYP3A4 Glycerol phenylbutyrate is a weak inducer of CYP3A4 in humans. Concomitant use of glycerol phenylbutyrate may decrease the systemic exposure to drugs that are substrates of CYP3A4. Monitor for decreased efficacy of drugs with narrow therapeutic index (e.g., alfentanil, quinidine, cyclosporine) [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. Midazolam Concomitant use of glycerol phenylbutyrate decreased the systemic exposure of midazolam. Monitor for suboptimal effect of midazolam in patients who are being treated with glycerol phenylbutyrate.
