=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Ganciclovir: Avoid concomitant use. ( 7.1 ) Valproic Acid or Divalproex Sodium: Avoid concomitant use. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Ganciclovir Generalized seizures have been reported in patients who received ganciclovir concomitantly with imipenem/cilastatin, a component of RECARBRIO. Ganciclovir should not be used concomitantly with RECARBRIO unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks. 7.2 Valproic Acid Based on case reports in the literature concomitant use of carbapenems, including imipenem/cilastatin, components of RECARBRIO, with valproic acid or divalproex sodium may decrease valproic acid concentrations which may increase the risk of breakthrough seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Although the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, data from in vitro and animal studies suggest that carbapenems may inhibit the hydrolysis of valproic acid's glucuronide metabolite (VPA-g) back to valproic acid, thus decreasing the serum concentrations of valproic acid . Avoid concomitant use of RECARBRIO with valproic acid or divalproex sodium. Consider alternative antibacterials other than carbapenems to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium.
