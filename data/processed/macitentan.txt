Drug: macitentan

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A4 inducers (rifampin) reduce exposure to macitentan: avoid co-administration with OPSUMIT ( 7.1 , 12.3 ). Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (ketoconazole, ritonavir) increase exposure to macitentan: avoid co-administration with OPSUMIT ( 7.2 , 12.3 ) . Moderate dual CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 inhibitors (fluconazole, amiodarone) or use of combined CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 inhibitors may increase exposure to macitentan: avoid co-administration with OPSUMIT ( 7.3 , 12.3 ). 7.1 Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Strong inducers of CYP3A4 such as rifampin significantly reduce macitentan exposure. Concomitant use of OPSUMIT with strong CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors like ketoconazole approximately double macitentan exposure. Many HIV drugs like ritonavir are strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Avoid concomitant use of OPSUMIT with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Use other PAH treatment options when strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are needed as part of HIV treatment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.3 Moderate Dual or Combined CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 Inhibitors Concomitant use of moderate dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 such as fluconazole is predicted to increase macitentan exposure approximately 4-fold based on physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling. Avoid concomitant use of OPSUMIT with moderate dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 (such as fluconazole and amiodarone) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Concomitant treatment of both a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor and moderate CYP2C9 inhibitor with OPSUMIT should also be avoided [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].
