=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors: Give one third of the recommended dosage of deflazacort oral suspension ( 7.1 ) Avoid use of moderate or strong CYP3A4 inducers with deflazacort oral suspension, as they may reduce efficacy ( 7.1 ) 7.1 CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers Moderate or Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors The active metabolite of deflazacort, 21-desDFZ, is a substrate of CYP3A4 [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Co-administration of deflazacort with clarithromycin, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased total exposure to 21-desDFZ by about 3-fold. Therefore, give one third the recommended dosage of deflazacort oral suspension when moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, fluconazole, diltiazem, verapamil, grapefruit juice) are used concomitantly with deflazacort oral suspension [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Moderate or Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Co-administration of deflazacort with rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, significantly decreased the exposure of 21-desDFZ. Avoid concomitant use of strong (e.g., efavirenz) or moderate (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin) CYP3A4 inducers with deflazacort oral suspension [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.2 Neuromuscular Blockers Patients receiving corticosteroids, including deflazacort oral suspension, and concomitant therapy with neuromuscular blocking drugs (e.g., pancuronium) may be at increased risk of developing an acute myopathy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )] .
