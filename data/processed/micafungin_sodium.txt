7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Monitor for sirolimus, itraconazole or nifedipine toxicity, and dosage of sirolimus, itraconazole or nifedipine should be reduced, if necessary. ( 7 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on Micafungin CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 Inhibitors Co-administration of micafungin with cyclosporine, itraconazole, voriconazole and fluconazole did not alter the pharmacokinetics of micafungin. CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 Inducer Co-administration of micafungin with rifampin and ritonavir did not alter the pharmacokinetics of micafungin. Co-administration of Micafungin with Other Drugs Co-administration of micafungin with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), amphotericin B, tacrolimus, prednisolone, sirolimus and nifedipine did not alter the pharmacokinetics of micafungin. 7.2 Effect of Micafungin on Other Drugs CYP3A4 Substrates There was no effect of single or multiple doses of micafungin on cyclosporine, tacrolimus, prednisolone, voriconazole and fluconazole pharmacokinetics. Sirolimus AUC was increased by 21% with no effect on C max in the presence of steady-state micafungin compared with sirolimus alone. Nifedipine AUC and C max were increased by 18% and 42%, respectively, in the presence of steady-state micafungin compared with nifedipine alone. Itraconazole AUC and Cmax were increased by 22% and 11%, respectively. Patients receiving sirolimus, nifedipine, and itraconazole in combination with micafungin should be monitored for sirolimus, nifedipine, and itraconazole toxicity and the sirolimus, nifedipine, and itraconazole dosage should be reduced if necessary.
