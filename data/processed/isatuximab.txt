Drug: isatuximab

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Laboratory Test Interference Interference with Serological Testing SARCLISA, an anti-CD38 antibody, may interfere with blood bank serologic tests with false positive reactions in indirect antiglobulin tests (indirect Coombs tests), antibody detection (screening) tests, antibody identification panels, and antihuman globulin crossmatches in patients treated with SARCLISA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Interference with Serum Protein Electrophoresis and Immunofixation Tests SARCLISA may be incidentally detected by serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation assays used for the monitoring of M-protein and may interfere with accurate response classification based on International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . In patients with persistent very good partial response, where interference is suspected, consider using an FDA-cleared isatuximab-irfc-specific IFE assay to distinguish isatuximab from any remaining endogenous M protein in the patient's serum to facilitate determination of a complete response.
