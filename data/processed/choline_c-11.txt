Drug: choline_c-11

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Colchicine and androgen-deprivation therapeutic drugs have been reported to interfere with choline-based PET imaging [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. The impact of androgen-deprivation therapeutic drugs upon 11 C-choline PET imaging may depend upon the hormonal responsiveness of a patient’s recurrent prostate cancer. Clinical studies have not established this relationship but published reports suggest 11 C-choline PET imaging may be productive in patients with “hormone resistant” recurrent prostate cancer even if the patients are receiving anti-androgen therapy. Imaging may prove unproductive or misleading due to failed or insufficient 11 C-choline uptake in patients with hormone-responsive cancer if the patients are receiving androgen-deprivation therapy. Colchicine and androgen-deprivation therapeutic drugs may interfere with 11 C-choline PET/CT imaging performance ( 5.1 ).
