Drug: nicotine

=== Drug Interactions ===
Drug Interactions The extent of absorption and peak plasma concentration is slightly reduced in patients with the common cold/rhinitis. In addition, the time to peak concentration is prolonged. The use of a nasal vasoconstrictor such as xylometazoline in patients with rhinitis will further prolong the time to peak (See PHARMACOKINETICS ). Smoking cessation, with or without nicotine replacement, may alter the pharmacokinetics of certain concomitant medications. May Require a Decrease in Dose at Cessation of Smoking Possible Mechanism Acetaminophen, caffeine, imipramine, oxazepam, pentazocine, propranolol, or other beta-blockers, theophylline Deinduction of hepatic enzymes on smoking cessation. Insulin Increase of subcutaneous insulin absorption with smoking cessation. Adrenergic antagonists (e.g. prazosin, labetalol) Decrease in circulating catecholamines with smoking cessation. May Require an Increase in Dose at Cessation of Smoking Possible Mechanism Adrenergic agonists (e.g. isoproterenol, phenylephrine) Decrease in circulating catecholamines with smoking cessation.
