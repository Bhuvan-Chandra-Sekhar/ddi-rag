Drug: droxidopa

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Use of DOPA decarboxylase inhibitors may require dose adjustments for droxidopa (7.2) 7.1 Drugs that Increase Blood Pressure Administering droxidopa in combination with other agents that increase blood pressure (e.g., norepinephrine, ephedrine, midodrine, and triptans) would be expected to increase the risk for supine hypertension. 7.2 Parkinson’s Medications Dopa-decarboxylase inhibitors may require dose adjustments for droxidopa. 7.3 Non-selective MAO Inhibitors The concomitant use of selective MAO-B inhibitors, such as rasagiline or selegiline, was permitted in the droxidopa clinical trials. However, based on mechanism of action, the use of non-selective MAO inhibitors and linezolid should be avoided as there is a potential for increased blood pressure when taken with droxidopa.
