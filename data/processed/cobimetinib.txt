=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid concomitant administration of COTELLIC with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers or inhibitors. ( 2.3 , 7.1 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Effect of Strong or Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors on COTELLIC Coadministration of COTELLIC with itraconazole (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) increased cobimetinib systemic exposure by 6.7-fold. Avoid concurrent use of COTELLIC and strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors. If concurrent short term (14 days or less) use of moderate CYP3A inhibitors including certain antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, ciprofloxacin) is unavoidable for patients who are taking COTELLIC 60 mg, reduce COTELLIC dose to 20 mg. After discontinuation of a moderate CYP3A inhibitor, resume COTELLIC at the previous dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Use an alternative to a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor in patients who are taking a reduced dose of COTELLIC (40 or 20 mg daily) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Effect of Strong or Moderate CYP3A Inducers on COTELLIC Coadministration of COTELLIC with a strong CYP3A inducer may decrease cobimetinib systemic exposure by more than 80% and reduce its efficacy. Avoid concurrent use of COTELLIC and strong or moderate CYP3A inducers including but not limited to carbamazepine, efavirenz, phenytoin, rifampin, and St. John's Wort [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .
