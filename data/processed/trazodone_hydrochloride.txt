7. Drug Interactions 7.1 Drugs Having Clinically Important Interactions with Trazodone Hydrochloride Tablets Table 3: Clinically Important Drug Interactions with Trazodone Hydrochloride Tablets Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) ClinicalImpact: The concomitant use of MAOIs and serotonergic drugs including Trazodone hydrochloride tablets increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. Intervention: Trazodone hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients taking MAOIs, including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue [seeCONTRAINDICATIONS(4),DOSAGEANDADMINISTRATION(2.3,2.4), and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS(5.2)]. Examples: isocarboxazid, moclobemide,phenelzine,selegiline, tranylcypromine Other Serotonergic Drugs ClinicalImpact: The concomitant use of serotonergic drugs including Trazodone hydrochloride tablets and other serotonergic drugs increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. Intervention: Monitorpatientsfor signsandsymptoms of serotoninsyndrome,particularly duringTrazodone hydrochloride tabletsinitiation. Ifserotoninsyndromeoccurs,considerdiscontinuation of Trazodone hydrochloride tablets and/or concomitantserotonergicdrugs[seeWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS(5.2)]. Examples: triptans,antidepressants(tricyclicandserotoninuptakeinhibitors),fentanyl,lithium,tramadol,tryptophan,buspirone,andSt.John's Wort AntiplateletAgents and Anticoagulants ClinicalImpact: Serotoninreleaseby platelets playsanimportantrole in hemostasis. Theconcurrentuseof an antiplateletagent or anticoagulantwithTrazodone hydrochloride tablets may potentiatetherisk of bleeding. Intervention: Inform patients of the increased risk of bleeding with the concomitantuse of Trazodone hydrochloride tablets and antiplateletagents and anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin,carefully monitor the internationalnormalizedratio(INR)wheninitiating or discontinuing Trazodone hydrochloride tablets[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS(5.5)]. Examples: warfarin, rivaroxaban,dabigatran,clopidogrel StrongCYP3A4Inhibitors ClinicalImpact: Theconcomitantuse of Trazodone hydrochloride tablets and strongCYP3A4inhibitors increased the exposureoftrazodonecomparedtotheuse of Trazodone hydrochloride tabletsalone. Intervention: If Trazodone hydrochloride tablets areusedwith a potentCYP3A4inhibitor,therisk of adversereactions,includingcardiac arrhythmias,may be increased and a lowerdose of Trazodone hydrochloride tablets should be considered[see DOSAGEANDADMINISTRATION (2.5), WARNINGSANDPRECAUTIONS(5.3)]. Examples: itraconazole,ketoconazole,clarithromycin,indinavir StrongCYP3A4Inducers ClinicalImpact: The concomitant use of Trazodone hydrochloride tablets and strongCYP3A4inducers decreased the exposure of trazodone compared to the use of Trazodone hydrochloride tablets alone. Intervention: Patients should be closely monitored to see if there is a need for an increased dose of Trazodone hydrochloride tabletswhentakingCYP3A4inducers[seeDosageandAdministration(2.5)]. Examples: rifampin,carbamazepine,phenytoin,St.John’swort DigoxinandPhenytoin ClinicalImpact: Digoxinand phenytoin are narrowtherapeutic index drugs. Concomitant use of Trazodone hydrochloride tabletscan increase digoxin or phenytoinconcentrations. Intervention: Measureserumdigoxinor phenytoinconcentrations beforeinitiatingconcomitantuse of Trazodone hydrochloride tablets.Continuemonitoring and reducedigoxin or phenytoindoseas necessary. Examples: digoxin, phenytoin CentralNervousSystem(CNS)Depressants ClinicalImpact: Trazodone hydrochloride tabletsmay enhancethe responseCNSdepressants. Intervention: Patients shouldbe counseledthatTrazodone hydrochloride tablets mayenhancetheresponsetoalcohol,barbiturates, and other CNSdepressants. Examples: alcohol,barbiturates QTIntervalProlongation ClinicalImpact: Concomitant use of drugs that prolong the QT interval may add to the QT effects of Trazodone hydrochloride tablets and increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmia. Intervention Avoid the use of Trazodone hydrochloride tablets in combination with other drugs known to prolongQTc[seeWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS(5.3)]. Examples: Class 1A antiarrhythmics:quinidine,procainamide,disopyramide; Class 3 antiarrhythmics:amiodarone,sotalol; Antipsychotics:ziprasidone,chlorpromazine,thioridazine;Antibiotics:gatifloxacin
