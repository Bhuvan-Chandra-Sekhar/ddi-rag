=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of antihypertensive medications and vasodilators: increased risk for hypotension, falls, and injuries. ( 7.2 ) Dopamine antagonists such as neuroleptics or metoclopramide, may diminish the effectiveness of ONAPGO. ( 7.4 ) 7.1 5HT 3 Antagonists Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of ONAPGO with 5HT 3 antagonists, including antiemetics (e.g., ondansetron, granisetron, palonosetron) and alosetron, is contraindicated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. 7.2 Antihypertensive Medications and Vasodilators In clinical studies with intermittent subcutaneous administration of apomorphine, the following adverse reactions were experienced more commonly in patients receiving concomitant antihypertensive medications or vasodilators (n=94) than in patients not receiving these medications (n=456): hypotension (10% vs 4%) myocardial infarction (3% vs 1%), [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4 , 5.11) ]. In a study of healthy subjects, concomitant administration of 0.4 mg sublingual nitroglycerin with subcutaneous apomorphine caused greater decreases in blood pressure than with subcutaneous apomorphine alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Patients treated with ONAPGO should lie down before and after taking sublingual nitroglycerin to decrease the potential risks associated with hypotension . 7.3 Alcohol In a study of healthy subjects, concomitant administration of high dose (0.6 g/kg) or low dose (0.3 g/kg) ethanol with apomorphine caused greater decreases in blood pressure than with apomorphine alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Patients should be advised not to consume alcohol while treated with ONAPGO because it may cause greater decreases in blood pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . 7.4 Dopamine Antagonists Because ONAPGO is a dopamine agonist, it is possible that concomitant use of dopamine antagonists, such as the neuroleptics (phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes) or metoclopramide, may diminish the effectiveness of ONAPGO. Antiemetics with anti-dopaminergic actions should be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Patients with major psychotic disorders, treated with neuroleptics, should be treated with dopamine agonists only if the potential benefits outweigh the risks [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. 7.5 Drugs Prolonging the QT/QTc Interval Caution should be exercised when prescribing ONAPGO concomitantly with drugs that prolong the QT/QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] .
