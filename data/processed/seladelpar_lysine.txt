=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Probenecid : Avoid concomitant use. ( 7.1 ) Strong CYP2C9 Inhibitors : Monitor for adverse effects. ( 7.1 ) Dual Moderate CYP2C9 and Moderate to Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors : Monitor for adverse effects. ( 7.1 ) CYP2C9 Poor Metabolizers using Moderate to Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors : Monitor for adverse effects. ( 7.1 ) Dual or Multiple Clinical Inhibitors of Drug Transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and BCRP : Monitor for adverse effects. ( 7.1 ) Rifampin : Monitor biochemical response (e.g., ALP and bilirubin) when patients initiate rifampin. ( 7.1 ) Bile Acid Sequestrants : Administer at least 4 hours before or 4 hours after taking a bile acid sequestrant, or at as great an interval as possible. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on LIVDELZI Table 2 includes clinically significant drug interactions affecting LIVDELZI. Table 2: Clinically Significant Interactions Affecting LIVDELZI Concomitant Drug or Class Potential Effect on Seladelpar Exposure ↑ = Increase, ↓ = Decrease. Clinical Intervention Probenecid ↑ seladelpar Avoid concomitant administration of LIVDELZI with probenecid. Strong CYP2C9 Inhibitors ↑ seladelpar Monitor patients for adverse effects during concomitant use of LIVDELZI with strong CYP2C9 inhibitors. Dual Moderate CYP2C9 and Moderate or Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors (e.g., fluconazole) ↑ seladelpar Monitor patients for adverse effects during concomitant use of LIVDELZI with drugs that are dual moderate CYP2C9 and moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. CYP2C9 Poor Metabolizers Using Moderate or Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors ↑ seladelpar Monitor patients who are CYP2C9 poor metabolizers for adverse effects during concomitant use of LIVDELZI with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. Dual or Multiple Clinical Inhibitors of Drug Transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and BCRP (e.g, cyclosporine) ↑ seladelpar Monitor patients for adverse effects during concomitant use of LIVDELZI with dual or multiple clinical inhibitors of drug transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and BCRP. Rifampin ↓ seladelpar Concomitant use of LIVDELZI with rifampin, an inducer of metabolizing enzymes, may result in delayed or suboptimal LIVDELZI biochemical response. Monitor the biochemical response (e.g., ALP and bilirubin) when patients initiate rifampin during LIVDELZI treatment. Bile Acid Sequestrants ↓ seladelpar Bile acid sequestrants may interfere with the action of LIVDELZI by reducing its absorption and systemic exposure, which may reduce LIVDELZI efficacy. Administer LIVDELZI at least 4 hours before or 4 hours after taking a bile acid sequestrant, or at as great an interval as possible [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] .
