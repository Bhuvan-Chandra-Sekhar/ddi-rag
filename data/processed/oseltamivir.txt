=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), intranasal: Avoid administration of LAIV within 2 weeks before or 48 hours after oseltamivir phosphate capsules, use, unless medically indicated. ( 7 ) 7.1 Influenza Vaccines Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine The concurrent use of oseltamivir phosphate capsules with live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) intranasal has not been evaluated. However, because of the potential for oseltamivir phosphate capsules to inhibit replication of live vaccine virus and possibly reduce the efficacy of LAIV, avoid administration of LAIV within 2 weeks before or 48 hours after oseltamivir phosphate capsules administration, unless medically indicated. Inactivated Influenza Vaccine Inactivated influenza vaccine can be administered at any time relative to use of oseltamivir phosphate capsules. 7.2 Drugs Without Clinically Significant Drug Interaction with Oseltamivir Phosphate Capsules No dose adjustments are needed for either oseltamivir or the concomitant drug when coadministering oseltamivir with amoxicillin, acetaminophen, aspirin, cimetidine, antacids (magnesium and aluminum hydroxides and calcium carbonates), rimantadine, amantadine, or warfarin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .
