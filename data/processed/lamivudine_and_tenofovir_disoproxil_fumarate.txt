=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Atazanavir: Atazanavir should be coadministered with ritonavir when coadministered with CIMDUO. ( 7.2 ) • HIV-1 Protease Inhibitors: Monitor for evidence of tenofovir toxicity when CIMDUO is coadministrated with atazanavir/ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, or lopinavir/ritonavir. ( 7.2 ) • Sorbitol: Avoid chronic administration of sorbitol with CIMDUO.( 7.5 ) 7.1 Drugs Affecting Renal Function Since tenofovir is primarily eliminated by the kidneys [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , coadministration of CIMDUO with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase serum concentrations of tenofovir and/or increase the concentrations of other renally eliminated drugs. Some examples include, but are not limited to cidofovir, acyclovir, valacyclovir, ganciclovir, valganciclovir, aminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin), and high-dose or multiple NSAIDs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 7.2 HIV-1 Protease Inhibitors TDF decreases the AUC and C min of atazanavir [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . When coadministered with CIMDUO, it is recommended that atazanavir 300 mg is given with ritonavir 100 mg. TDF should not be coadministered with atazanavir without ritonavir. Lopinavir/ritonavir, atazanavir coadministered with ritonavir, and darunavir coadministered with ritonavir have been shown to increase tenofovir concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Patients receiving CIMDUO concomitantly with lopinavir/ritonavir, atazanavir and ritonavir, or darunavir and ritonavir should be monitored for tenofovir-associated adverse reactions. CIMDUO should be discontinued in patients who develop tenofovir-associated adverse reactions. 7.3 Hepatitis C Antiviral Agents Coadministration of TDF, a component of CIMDUO, and EPCLUSA ® (sofosbuvir/velpatasvir) or HARVONI ® (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir) has been shown to increase tenofovir exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . In patients receiving TDF concomitantly with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, monitor for adverse reactions associated with TDF. In patients receiving CIMDUO concomitantly with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir without an HIV-1 protease inhibitor/ritonavir or an HIV-1 protease inhibitor/cobicistat combination, monitor for adverse reactions associated with tenofovir. In patients receiving CIMDUO concomitantly with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and an HIV-1 protease inhibitor/ritonavir or an HIV-1 protease inhibitor/cobicistat combination, consider an alternative HCV or antiretroviral therapy, as the safety of increased tenofovir concentrations in this setting has not been established. If coadministration is necessary, monitor for adverse reactions associated with tenofovir. 7.4 Drugs Inhibiting Organic Cation Transporters 3TC, a component of CIMDUO, is predominantly eliminated in the urine by active organic cationic secretion. The possibility of interactions with other drugs administered concurrently should be considered, particularly when their main route of elimination is active renal secretion via the organic cationic transport system (e.g., trimethoprim) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . No data are available regarding interactions with other drugs that have renal clearance mechanisms similar to that of 3TC. 7.5 Sorbitol Coadministration of single doses of 3TC and sorbitol resulted in a sorbitol dose-dependent reduction in 3TC exposures. When possible, avoid use of sorbitol-containing medicines with 3TC [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .
