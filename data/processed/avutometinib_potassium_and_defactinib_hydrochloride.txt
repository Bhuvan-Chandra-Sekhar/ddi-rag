7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors : Avoid concomitant use with AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA CO-PACK. ( 7.1 ) Strong and moderate CYP3A4 inducers : Avoid concomitant use with AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA CO-PACK. ( 7.1 ) Warfarin : Avoid concomitant use of AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA CO-PACK with warfarin and use an alternative to warfarin. ( 7.2 ) Gastric acid reducing agents : Avoid concomitant use of AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA CO-PACK with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or H2 receptor antagonists. If use of an acid-reducing agent cannot be avoided, administer FAKZYNJA 2 hours before or 2 hours after the administration of a locally acting antacid. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA CO-PACK Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors Avoid concomitant use of AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA CO-PACK with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors. Defactinib is a CYP3A4 substrate. Concomitant use of defactinib with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor increases defactinib exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], which may increase the risk of AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA CO-PACK adverse reactions. Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers Avoid concomitant use of AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA CO-PACK with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers. Defactinib is a CYP3A4 substrate. Concomitant use of defactinib with a strong CYP3A4 inducer decreases defactinib exposure, which may reduce the effectiveness of FAKZYNJA [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Gastric Acid Reducing Agents Avoid concomitant use of AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA CO-PACK with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or H2 receptor antagonists. If concomitant use of an acid-reducing agent cannot be avoided, administer FAKZYNJA 2 hours before or 2 hours after the administration of a locally acting antacid. Concomitant use of FAKZYNJA with gastric acid reducing agents decreases defactinib exposure, which may reduce the effectiveness of AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA CO-PACK [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Effect of AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA CO-PACK on Other Drugs Warfarin Avoid concomitant use of AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA CO-PACK with warfarin. For patients requiring anticoagulation, an alternative to warfarin is recommended. If concomitant use is unavoidable, monitor INR frequently during treatment with AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA CO-PACK. Cases of bleeding and increased INR occurred in patients taking FAKZYNJA concomitantly with warfarin in clinical trials.
