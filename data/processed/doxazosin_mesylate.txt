Drug: doxazosin_mesylate

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibitors may increase exposure to doxazosin and increased risk of hypotension ( 7.1 ) Concomitant administration of doxazosin tablets with a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor can result in additive blood pressure lowering effects and symptomatic hypotension. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 CYP3A Inhibitors In vitro studies suggest that doxazosin is a substrate of CYP3A4. Strong CYP3A inhibitors may increase exposure to doxazosin. Monitor blood pressure and for symptoms of hypotension when doxazosin tablets are used concomitantly with strong CYP3A inhibitors [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) Inhibitors Concomitant administration of doxazosin tablets with a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor can result in additive blood pressure lowering effects and symptomatic hypotension. Monitor blood pressure and for symptoms of hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .
