Drug: triclabendazole

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CYP2C19 Substrates : Re-check the plasma concentration of concomitantly administered CYP2C19 substrates after cessation of EGATEN therapy, if the plasma concentrations of the CYP2C19 substrates are elevated during administration of EGATEN. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Effect of EGATEN on CYP2C19 Substrates No specific clinical drug interaction studies have been conducted for triclabendazole. However, in vitro data suggest the potential for increased plasma concentrations of CYP2C19 substrates with concomitant use of triclabendazole [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . The potential elevation in concentrations of concomitantly used CYP2C19 substrates is expected to be transient based on the short elimination half-life and short treatment duration of triclabendazole. For those CYP2C19 substrate drugs that require therapeutic monitoring of systemic drug exposures, if the plasma concentrations of the CYP2C19 substrates are elevated during administration of triclabendazole, re-check the plasma concentration of the CYP2C19 substrates after cessation of triclabendazole therapy.
