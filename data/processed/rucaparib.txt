=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Effect of Rubraca on Other Drugs Certain CYP1A2, CYP3A, CYP2C9, or CYP2C19 Substrates Concomitant administration of Rubraca with CYP1A2, CYP3A, CYP2C9, or CYP2C19 substrates can increase the systemic exposure of these substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may increase the frequency or severity of adverse reactions of these substrates. If concomitant administration is unavoidable between Rubraca and substrates of these enzymes where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions, decrease the substrate dosage in accordance with the approved prescribing information. If concomitant administration with warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) cannot be avoided, consider increasing the frequency of international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring.
