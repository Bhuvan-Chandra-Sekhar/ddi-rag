Drug: lazertinib

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong and moderate CYP3A4 inducers: Avoid concomitant use. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on LAZCLUZE CYP3A4 Inducers Avoid concomitant use of LAZCLUZE with strong and moderate CYP3A4 inducers. Consider an alternate concomitant medication with no potential to induce CYP3A4. Lazertinib is a CYP3A4 substrate. Concomitant use with a strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducer decreased lazertinib concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , which may reduce the efficacy of lazertinib. 7.2 Effect of LAZCLUZE on Other Drugs Certain CYP3A4 Substrates Monitor for adverse reactions associated with a CYP3A4 substrate where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions, as recommended in the approved product labeling for the CYP3A4 substrate. Lazertinib is a weak CYP3A4 inhibitor. Concomitant use of LAZCLUZE increased concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , which may increase the risk of adverse reactions related to these substrates. Certain BCRP Substrates Monitor for adverse reactions associated with a BCRP substrate where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions, as recommended in the approved product labeling for the BCRP substrate. Lazertinib is a BCRP inhibitor. Concomitant use of LAZCLUZE increased concentrations of BCRP substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], which may increase the risk of adverse reactions related to these substrates.
