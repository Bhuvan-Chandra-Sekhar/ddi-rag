7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Beta-Adrenergic Blockers The use of beta-adrenergic blockers may impair reversal of Provocholine-caused bronchoconstriction. Beta-Agonists, Anticholinergics, and Theophylline Beta-agonists, anticholinergics, and theophylline inhibit the response of airways to Provocholine; therefore, hold these drugs before Provocholine use for the following duration: • Short-acting β-agonists (e.g., albuterol): 6 hours • Long-acting β-agonists (e.g., salmeterol): 36 hours • Short-acting anti-cholinergics (e.g., ipratropium): 12 hours • Long-acting anti-cholinergics (e.g., tiotropium): ≥168 hours • Oral theophylline: 12-48 hours Oral or Inhaled Corticosteroids, and Inhaled Cromoglycate Regular use of oral or inhaled corticosteroids and inhaled cromoglycate may acutely decrease bronchial responsiveness to Provocholine. However, these drugs may be continued with Provocholine use. Beta-Adrenergic Blockers : May impair reversal of Provocholine-caused bronchoconstriction (7) Beta-Agonists, Anticholinergics, and Theophylline : Inhibit response to Provocholine; therefore, hold these drugs prior to Provocholine use (7) Oral or Inhaled Corticosteroids, and Inhaled Cromyoglycate : May decrease response to Provocholine (7)
