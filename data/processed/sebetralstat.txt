Drug: sebetralstat

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors : Avoid use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. In patients taking moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, take one dose of 300 mg. A second dose of 300 mg may be taken at least 3 hours after the first dose if response is inadequate, or if symptoms worsen or recur. ( 2.2 , 7.1 , 12.3 ) CYP3A4 Inducers : Avoid use with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inducers. ( 2.2 , 7.1 , 12.3 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on EKTERLY Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Avoid use of EKTERLY with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Sebetralstat is a substrate of CYP3A4. Concomitant use of sebetralstat with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor increases sebetralstat exposure, which may increase the risk of sebetralstat adverse reactions. Moderate and Weak CYP3A4 Inhibitors Reduce dose of EKTERLY to one dose of 300 mg (one tablet) orally at the earliest recognition of an HAE attack when used concomitantly with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors. A second dose of 300 mg (one tablet) may be taken at least 3 hours after the first dose if response is inadequate, or if symptoms worsen or recur [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Sebetralstat is a substrate of CYP3A4. Concomitant use of sebetralstat with a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor increases sebetralstat exposure, which may increase the risk of sebetralstat adverse reactions. No dose modification is recommended when EKTERLY is used concomitantly with a weak CYP3A4 inhibitor [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers Use of EKTERLY with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended. Sebetralstat is a substrate of CYP3A4. Concomitant use of sebetralstat with a strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducer decreases sebetralstat exposure, which may decrease efficacy. Weak CYP3A4 Inducers No dose modification is recommended when EKTERLY is used concomitantly with weak CYP3A4 inducers [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] .
