Drug: dihydroergotamine_mesylate

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Beta Blockers/Nicotine: May potentiate/provoke vasoconstriction. ( 7.3 , 7.5 ) Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors: Weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination may occur with coadministration. ( 7.6 ) 7.1 CYP3A4 Inhibitors There have been rare reports of serious adverse events in connection with the coadministration of intravenous administration of dihydroergotamine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, resulting in vasospasm that led to cerebral ischemia and/or ischemia of the extremities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. The use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with ATZUMI is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) ]. Administer moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors with caution. 7.2 Triptans Triptans (serotonin [5-HT] 1B/1D receptor agonists) have been reported to cause coronary artery vasospasm, and its effects could be additive with ATZUMI. Therefore, triptans and ATZUMI should not be taken within 24 hours of each other [see Contraindications (4) ] . 7.3 Beta Blockers There have been reports that propranolol may potentiate the vasoconstrictive action of ergotamine by blocking the vasodilating property of epinephrine. 7.4 Vasoconstrictors ATZUMI is contraindicated for use with peripheral and central vasoconstrictors because the combination may cause synergistic elevation of blood pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . 7.5 Nicotine Nicotine may provoke vasoconstriction in some patients, predisposing to a greater ischemic response to ergot therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.4) ] . 7.6 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors Weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination have been reported rarely when 5-HT 1 agonists have been co-administered with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline).
