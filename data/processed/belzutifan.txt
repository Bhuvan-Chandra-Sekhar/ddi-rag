=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS UGT2B17 or CYP2C19 Inhibitors: Monitor for signs and symptoms of anemia and hypoxia and reduce the dosage of WELIREG as recommended. ( 2.2 , 7.1 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on WELIREG UGT2B17 or CYP2C19 Inhibitors Monitor for anemia and hypoxia and reduce the dosage of WELIREG as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.2) , Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Coadministration of WELIREG with inhibitors of UGT2B17 or CYP2C19 increases belzutifan exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 , 12.5) ] , which may increase the risk of adverse reactions of WELIREG. 7.2 Effect of WELIREG on Other Drugs CYP3A4 Substrates Avoid coadministration of WELIREG with sensitive CYP3A4 substrates, for which minimal decrease in concentration may lead to therapeutic failures of the substrate. If coadministration cannot be avoided, increase the sensitive CYP3A4 substrate dosage in accordance with its Prescribing Information. Coadministration of WELIREG with CYP3A4 substrates decreases concentrations of CYP3A substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , which may reduce the efficacy of these substrates. The magnitude of this decrease may be more pronounced in patients who are dual UGT2B17 and CYP2C19 poor metabolizers [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Hormonal Contraceptives Coadministration of WELIREG with hormonal contraceptives may lead to contraceptive failure or an increase in breakthrough bleeding [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] .
