Drug: lidocaine___prilocaine

=== Drug Interactions ===
Drug Interactions Lidocaine and prilocaine cream should be used with caution in patients receiving Class I antiarrhythmic drugs (such as tocainide and mexiletine) since the toxic effects are additive and potentially synergistic. Prilocaine may contribute to the formation of methemoglobin in patients treated with other drugs known to cause this condition (see Methemoglobinemia subsection of WARNINGS). Specific interaction studies with lidocaine/prilocaine and class III anti-arrhythmic drugs (e.g., amiodarone, bretylium, sotalol, dofetilide) have not been performed, but caution is advised (see WARNINGS). Should lidocaine and prilocaine cream be used concomitantly with other products containing lidocaine and/or prilocaine, cumulative doses from all formulations must be considered. Patients that are administered local anesthetics may be at increased risk of developing methemoglobinemia when concurrently exposed to the following oxidizing agents: Class Examples Nitrates/Nitrites nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, nitric oxide, nitrous oxide Local anesthetics benzocaine, lidocaine, bupivacaine, mepivacaine, tetracaine, prilocaine, procaine, articaine, ropivacaine Antineoplastic agents cyclophosphamide, flutamide, rasburicase, ifosfamide, hydroxyurea Antibiotics dapsone, sulfonamides, nitrofurantoin, para-aminosalicylic acid Antimalarials chloroquine, primaquine Anticonvulsants phenytoin, sodium valproate, phenobarbital Other drugs acetaminophen, metoclopramide, sulfa drugs (i.e., sulfasalazine), quinine
