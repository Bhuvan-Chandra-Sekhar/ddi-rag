Drug: capivasertib

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Strong CYP3A Inhibitors : Avoid concomitant use. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, reduce TRUQAP dose. ( 2.5 , 7.1 ) • Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors: Reduce TRUQAP dose. ( 2.5 , 7.1 ) • Strong and Moderate CYP3A Inducers: Avoid concomitant use. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on TRUQAP Table 6 describes drug interactions where concomitant use of another drug affects TRUQAP. Table 6: Drug Interactions with TRUQAP Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Clinical Impact • Capivasertib is a CYP3A substrate. Strong CYP3A inhibitors increase capivasertib exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], which may increase the risk of TRUQAP adverse reactions. Prevention or Management • Avoid concomitant use with a strong CYP3A inhibitor. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, reduce the dose of TRUQAP and monitor patients for adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Clinical Impact • Capivasertib is a CYP3A substrate. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors increase capivasertib exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], which may increase the risk of TRUQAP adverse reactions. Prevention or Management • When concomitantly used with moderate CYP3A inhibitor, reduce the dose of TRUQAP and monitor patients for adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Strong and Moderate CYP3A Inducers Clinical Impact • Capivasertib is a CYP3A substrate. Strong and moderate CYP3A inducers decrease capivasertib exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], which may reduce the effectiveness of TRUQAP. Prevention or Management • Avoid concomitant use of TRUQAP with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers.
