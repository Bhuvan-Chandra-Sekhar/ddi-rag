Drug: fenfluramine

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Dose adjustment is required for patients taking stiripentol plus clobazam. ( 2.2 , 2.3 , 7.1 ) Strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors: a dose adjustment is recommended ( 2.3 , 7.1 ) Strong CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4 inducers: it is recommended to avoid coadministration with FINTEPLA. If coadministration is necessary, consider a FINTEPLA dosage increase. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on FINTEPLA Stiripentol Plus Clobazam Coadministration of FINTEPLA with stiripentol plus clobazam, with or without valproate, increases fenfluramine plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. If FINTEPLA is coadministered with stiripentol plus clobazam, the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA is 0.2 mg/kg twice daily (maximum daily dosage of 17 mg) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Strong CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A Inducers Coadministration of FINTEPLA with strong CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A inducers will decrease fenfluramine plasma concentrations, which may lower the efficacy of FINTEPLA [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . It is recommended to avoid coadministration of strong CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A inducers. If coadministration of a strong CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A inducer with FINTEPLA is necessary, monitor the patient for reduced efficacy and consider increasing the dosage of FINTEPLA as needed; however, do not exceed the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. If a strong CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A inducer is discontinued during maintenance treatment with FINTEPLA, consider gradual reduction in the FINTEPLA dosage to the dose administered prior to initiating the inducer [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 Inhibitors Coadministration of FINTEPLA with strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors will increase fenfluramine plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . If FINTEPLA is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors, the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA is 20 mg [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. If a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued during maintenance treatment with FINTEPLA, consider gradual increase in the FINTEPLA dosage to the dose recommended without CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors; however, do not exceed the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. If FINTEPLA is coadministered with stiripentol and a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor, do not exceed the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA of 17 mg [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 7.2 Effects of Serotonin Receptor Antagonists Cyproheptadine and potent 5-HT1A, 5-HT1D, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C serotonin receptor antagonists may decrease the efficacy of FINTEPLA. If cyproheptadine or potent 5--HT1A, 5--HT1D, 5-HT2A, or 5-HT2C serotonin receptor antagonists are coadministered with FINTEPLA, patients should be monitored appropriately. 7.3 Serotonergic Drugs Concomitant administration of FINTEPLA and drugs (e.g., SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, MAO inhibitors, trazodone, etc.), over-the-counter medications (e.g., dextromethorphan), or herbal supplements (e.g., St. John's Wort) that increase serotonin may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Concomitant use of FINTEPLA is contraindicated within 14 days of taking MAOIs. Use FINTEPLA with caution in patients taking other medications that increase serotonin.
