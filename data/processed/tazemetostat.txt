Drug: tazemetostat

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong or Moderate Cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A Inhibitors : Avoid coadministration of strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors with TAZVERIK. Reduce the dose of TAZVERIK if coadministration of strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors cannot be avoided. ( 2.3 , 7.1 ) Strong or Moderate CYP3A Inducers : Avoid coadministration with TAZVERIK. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on TAZVERIK Strong or Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Coadministration of TAZVERIK with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor increases tazemetostat plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )], which may increase the frequency or severity of adverse reactions. Avoid coadministration of strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors with TAZVERIK. If coadministration of strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors cannot be avoided, reduce TAZVERIK dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. Strong or Moderate CYP3A Inducers Coadministration of TAZVERIK with a strong CYP3A inducer decreases tazemetostat plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , and coadministration of TAZVERIK with a moderate CYP3A inducer may also decrease tazemetostat plasma concentrations. The decrease in tazemetostat plasma concentration may decrease the efficacy of TAZVERIK. Avoid coadministration of moderate or strong CYP3A inducers with TAZVERIK. 7.2 Effect of TAZVERIK on Other Drugs CYP3A Substrates Coadministration of TAZVERIK with CYP3A substrates, including hormonal contraceptives, can result in decreased concentrations and reduced efficacy of CYP3A substrates [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.3 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] .
