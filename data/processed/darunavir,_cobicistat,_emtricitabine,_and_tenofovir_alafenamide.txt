=== Drug Interactions ===
7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Co-administration of SYMTUZA with other drugs can alter the concentration of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentrations of SYMTUZA components. Consult the full prescribing information prior to and during treatment for potential drug interactions. ( 4 , 5.4 , 7 , 12.3 ) 7.1 Not Recommended With Other Antiretroviral Medications SYMTUZA is a complete regimen for HIV-1 infection and co-administration with other antiretroviral medications for the treatment of HIV-1 infection is not recommended. For this reason, information regarding potential drug-drug interactions with other antiretroviral medications is not provided. 7.2 Potential for SYMTUZA to Affect Other Drugs Darunavir co-administered with cobicistat is an inhibitor of CYP3A and CYP2D6. Cobicistat inhibits the following transporters: P-glycoprotein (P-gp), BCRP, MATE1, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Therefore, co-administration of SYMTUZA with drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A and/or CYP2D6, or are substrates of P-gp, BCRP, MATE1, OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 may result in increased plasma concentrations of such drugs, which could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and can be associated with adverse events. Co-administration of SYMTUZA with drugs that have active metabolite(s) formed by CYP3A may result in reduced plasma concentrations of these active metabolite(s), potentially leading to loss of their therapeutic effect (see Table 4 ). 7.3 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect SYMTUZA Darunavir is metabolized by CYP3A. Cobicistat is metabolized by CYP3A and, to a minor extent, by CYP2D6. Co-administration of drugs that induce CYP3A activity are expected to increase the clearance of darunavir and cobicistat, resulting in lowered plasma concentrations which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance. Co-administration of SYMTUZA with other drugs that inhibit CYP3A may result in increased plasma concentrations of darunavir and cobicistat (see Table 4 ). Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is a substrate of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3. Drugs that strongly affect P-gp activity may lead to changes in TAF absorption. Drugs that induce P-gp activity are expected to decrease the absorption of TAF, resulting in decreased plasma concentrations of TAF, which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect of SYMTUZA and development of resistance. Co-administration of SYMTUZA with other drugs that inhibit P-gp may increase the absorption and plasma concentrations of TAF (see Table 4 ). 7.4 Drugs Affecting Renal Function Because emtricitabine and tenofovir are primarily excreted by the kidneys through glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion, co-administration of SYMTUZA with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir, and other renally eliminated drugs and this may increase the risk of adverse reactions. Some examples of drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion include, but are not limited to, acyclovir, cidofovir, ganciclovir, valacyclovir, valganciclovir, aminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin), and high-dose or multiple NSAIDs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . 7.5 Significant Drug Interactions Table 4 provides examples of established or potentially clinically significant drug interactions with SYMTUZA and recommended steps to prevent or manage these interactions. These recommendations are based on drug interaction trials conducted with the components of SYMTUZA, as individual agents or in combination, or are predicted interactions. No drug interaction trials have been performed with SYMTUZA or with all the components administered together. Drug interaction trials have been conducted with darunavir co-administered with ritonavir or cobicistat or with emtricitabine and tenofovir prodrugs. The table includes potentially significant interactions but is not all inclusive , and therefore the label of each drug that is co- administered with SYMTUZA should be consulted for information related to the route of metabolism, interaction pathways, potential risks, and specific actions to be taken with regard to co- administration. Table 4: Significant Drug Interactions Concomitant Drug Class: Drug Name Examples Effect on Concentration Clinical Comment This table is not all inclusive ↑ = increase, ↓ = decrease, ↔ = no effect Alpha 1-adrenoreceptor antagonist: alfuzosin ↑ alfuzosin Co-administration is contraindicated due to potential for serious and/or life-threatening reactions such as hypotension. Antibacterials: clarithromycin, erythromycin, telithromycin ↑ darunavir ↑ cobicistat ↑ antibacterial Consider alternative antibiotics with concomitant use of SYMTUZA. Anticancer agents: dasatinib, nilotinib ↑ anticancer agent A decrease in the dosage or an adjustment of the dosing interval of dasatinib or nilotinib may be necessary when co-administered with SYMTUZA. Consult the dasatinib and nilotinib prescribing information for dosing instructions. vinblastine, vincristine For vincristine and vinblastine, consider temporarily withholding the cobicistat-containing antiretroviral regimen in patients who develop significant hematologic or gastrointestinal side effects when SYMTUZA is administered concurrently with vincristine or vinblastine. If the antiretroviral regimen must be withheld for a prolonged period, consider initiating a revised regimen that does not include a CYP3A or P-gp inhibitor. Anticoagulants: Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) apixaban ↑ apixaban Due to potentially increased bleeding risk, dosing recommendations for co-administration of apixaban with SYMTUZA depend on the apixaban dose.
