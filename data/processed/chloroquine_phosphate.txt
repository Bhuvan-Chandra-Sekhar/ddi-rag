Drug: chloroquine_phosphate

=== Drug Interactions ===
Drug Interactions Antacids and kaolin: Antacids and kaolin can reduce absorption of chloroquine; an interval of at least 4 hours between intake of these agents and chloroquine should be observed. Cimetidine: Cimetidine can inhibit the metabolism of chloroquine, increasing its plasma level. Concomitant use of cimetidine should be avoided. Insulin and other antidiabetic drugs: As chloroquine may enhance the effects of a hypoglycemic treatment, a decrease in doses of insulin or other antidiabetic drugs may be required. Arrhythmogenic drugs: There may be an increased risk of inducing ventricular arrhythmias if chloroquine is used concomitantly with other arrhythmogenic drugs, such as amiodarone or moxifloxacin. Ampicillin: In a study of healthy volunteers, chloroquine significantly reduced the bioavailability of ampicillin. An interval of at least two hours between intake of ampicillin and chloroquine should be observed. Cyclosporine: After introduction of chloroquine (oral form), a sudden increase in serum cyclosporine level has been reported. Therefore, close monitoring of serum cyclosporine level is recommended and, if necessary, chloroquine should be discontinued. Mefloquine: Co-administration of chloroquine and mefloquine may increase the risk of convulsions. The blood concentrations of chloroquine and desethylchloroquine (the major metabolite of chloroquine, which also has antimalarial properties) were negatively associated with log antibody titers. Chloroquine taken in the dose recommended for malaria prophylaxis can reduce the antibody response to primary immunization with intradermal human diploid-cell rabies vaccine. Praziquantel: In a single-dose interaction study, chloroquine has been reported to reduce the bioavailability of praziquantel. Tamoxifen: Concomitant use of chloroquine with drugs known to induce retinal toxicity such as tamoxifen is not recommended (see WARNINGS ).
