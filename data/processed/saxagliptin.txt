Drug: saxagliptin

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) : Coadministration with saxagliptin significantly increases saxagliptin concentrations. Limit saxagliptin dosage to 2.5 mg once daily when coadministered with a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Strong Inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 Enzymes Ketoconazole significantly increased saxagliptin exposure. Similar significant increases in plasma concentrations of saxagliptin are anticipated with other strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors (e.g., atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and telithromycin). The dosage of saxagliptin should be limited to 2.5 mg when coadministered with a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor [ se e Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycemia. Concomitant use of saxagliptin with insulin or an insulin secretagogue may require lower dosages of insulin or the insulin secretagogue to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ].
