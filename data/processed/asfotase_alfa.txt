Drug: asfotase_alfa

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drug Interference with Laboratory Tests: Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) is used as a detection reagent in many laboratory tests and the presence of asfotase alfa in clinical laboratory samples could result in erroneous test results. Inform laboratory personnel and discuss use of an alternative testing platform for patients on treatment. ( 7.1 ) Serum Alkaline Phosphatase : Serum ALP measurements are expected to be elevated during treatment and may be unreliable for clinical decision making. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Drug Interference with Laboratory Tests Laboratory Tests Utilizing Alkaline Phosphatase as a Detection Reagent Studies have shown that there is analytical interference between asfotase alfa and laboratory tests that utilize an alkaline phosphatase (ALP)-conjugated test system, rendering erroneous test results in patients treated with STRENSIQ. ALP-conjugated test systems are utilized to measure substances such as hormones, bacterial antigens and antibodies. Therefore, it is recommended that laboratory assays which do not have ALP-conjugate technology be used when testing samples from patients who are receiving STRENSIQ. To avoid erroneous test results for patients treated with STRENSIQ, inform laboratory personnel that the patient is being treated with STRENSIQ and discuss the use of a testing platform which does not utilize an ALP-conjugated test system. Serum Alkaline Phosphatase High serum ALP measurements detected through clinical laboratory testing are expected in patients receiving STRENSIQ and reflect circulating concentrations of asfotase alfa . Do not rely on serum ALP measurements for clinical decision making in patients treated with STRENSIQ.
