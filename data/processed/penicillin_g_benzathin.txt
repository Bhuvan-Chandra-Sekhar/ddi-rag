Drug: penicillin_g_benzathin

=== Drug Interactions ===
Bacteriostatic antibiotics: Bacteriostatic antibiotics, such as tetracycline, erythromycin and chloramphenicol, may antagonize the bactericidal effect of benzylpenicillin by interfering with active bacterial growth necessary to benzylpenicillin’s effect. Oral contraceptives: The efficacy of oral contraceptives may be impaired in case of concomitant therapy with benzylpenicillin, which may result in an unwanted pregnancy. Women taking oral contraceptives should be alerted to this situation and should be informed about the need to adopt alternative methods of contraception. Methotrexate: Penicillins may reduce the renal excretion of methotrexate causing a potential increase in its toxicity. Probenecid: Probenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of benzylpenicillin. Its concomitant use with benzylpenicillin can prolong blood levels of benzylpenicillin. Probenecid may be used therapeutically for this purpose.
