=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Avoid concomitant administration. ( 7.1 ) Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Avoid another dose within 48 hours when administered with a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor. ( 7.1 ) Strong and Moderate CYP3A Inducers: Avoid concomitant administration. ( 7.2 ) Potent Inhibitors of P-gp: Avoid another dose of NURTEC ODT within 48 hours when administered with a potent P-gp inhibitor. ( 7.3 ) 7.1 CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant administration of NURTEC ODT with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 results in a significant increase in rimegepant exposure. Avoid concomitant administration of NURTEC ODT with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Concomitant administration of NURTEC ODT with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in increased exposure of rimegepant. Avoid another dose of NURTEC ODT within 48 hours when it is concomitantly administered with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 CYP3A Inducers Concomitant administration of NURTEC ODT with strong or moderate inducers of CYP3A can result in a significant reduction in rimegepant exposure, which may lead to loss of efficacy of NURTEC ODT. Avoid concomitant administration of NURTEC ODT with strong or moderate inducers of CYP3A [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.3 P-gp Inhibitors Concomitant administration of NURTEC ODT with potent inhibitors of P-gp (e.g., amiodarone, cyclosporine, lapatinib, quinidine, ranolazine) may result in increased exposure of rimegepant. Avoid another dose of NURTEC ODT within 48 hours when it is concomitantly administered with potent inhibitors of P-gp [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .
