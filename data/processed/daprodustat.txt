Drug: daprodustat

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Moderate CYP2C8 Inhibitors: Reduce starting dose. ( 7.1 ) • CYP2C8 Inducers: Monitor hemoglobin and adjust the dose of JESDUVROQ as appropriate. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 CYP2C8 Inhibitors Concomitant administration of strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) with JESDUVROQ is contraindicated due to a marked increase in daprodustat exposure [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Concomitant administration of moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., clopidogrel) increases daprodustat exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Reduce the starting dose of JESDUVROQ by half when initiating treatment in patients on clopidogrel or a moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor except in patients whose starting dose is already 1 mg. Monitor hemoglobin and adjust the dose of JESDUVROQ when initiating or stopping therapy with clopidogrel or a moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor during treatment with JESDUVROQ [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . 7.2 CYP2C8 Inducers CYP2C8 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may decrease daprodustat exposure, which may result in loss of efficacy. Monitor hemoglobin and adjust the dose of JESDUVROQ when initiating or stopping therapy with CYP2C8 inducers during treatment with JESDUVROQ [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] .
