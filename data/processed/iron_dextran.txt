=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Drug interactions involving INFeD have not been studied. Concomitant use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor drugs may increase the risk for anaphylactic-type reactions to an iron dextran product. Large doses of iron dextran (5 mL or more) have been reported to give a brown color to serum from a blood sample drawn 4 hours after administration. INFeD may cause falsely elevated values of serum bilirubin and falsely decreased values of serum calcium. Serum iron determinations (especially by colorimetric assays) may not be meaningful for 3 weeks following the administration of INFeD. Examination of the bone marrow for iron stores may not be meaningful for prolonged periods following iron dextran therapy because residual iron dextran may remain in the reticuloendothelial cells. Bone scans involving 99m Tc-diphosphonate have been reported to show a dense, crescentic area of activity in the buttocks, following the contour of the iliac crest, 1 to 6 days after intramuscular injections of INFeD. Bone scans with 99m Tc-labeled bone seeking agents, in the presence of high serum ferritin levels or following INFeD infusions, have been reported to show reduction of bony uptake, marked renal activity, and excessive blood pool and soft tissue accumulation.
