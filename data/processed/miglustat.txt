Drug: miglustat

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS While co-administration of miglustat appeared to increase the clearance of imiglucerase by 70%, these results are not conclusive because of the small number of patients studied and because patients took variable doses of imiglucerase [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Co-administration of miglustat and imiglucerase may lead to increased clearance of imiglucerase ( 7 ).
