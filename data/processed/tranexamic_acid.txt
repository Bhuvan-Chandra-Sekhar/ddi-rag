=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with tranexamic acid tablets. Concomitant therapy with tissue plasminogen activators may decrease the efficacy of both tranexamic acid tablets and tissue plasminogen activators. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Combined Hormonal Contraceptives Because tranexamic acid tablets are antifibrinolytic, concomitant use of combined hormonal contraception and tranexamic acid tablets may increase the thrombotic risk associated with combined hormonal contraceptives. For this reason, concomitant use of tranexamic acid tablets with combined hormonal contraceptives is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 7.2 Tissue Plasminogen Activators Concomitant therapy with tissue plasminogen activators may decrease the efficacy of both tranexamic acid tablets and tissue plasminogen activators. Discontinue tranexamic acid tablets if a patient requires tissue plasminogen activators. 7.3 Factor IX Complex Concentrates or Anti-Inhibitor Coagulant Concentrates Tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients taking either Factor IX complex concentrates or anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates because the risk of thrombosis may be increased [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) 7.4 All-Trans Retinoic Acid (Oral Tretinoin) Tranexamic acid tablets are not recommended in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia taking all-trans retinoic acid for remission induction because of possible exacerbation of the procoagulant effect of all-trans retinoic acid [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )].
