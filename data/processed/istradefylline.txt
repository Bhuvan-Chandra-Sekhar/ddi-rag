Drug: istradefylline

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors: Recommended maximum dosage with concomitant use is 20 mg once daily ( 2.2 , 7.1 ). Strong CYP3A4 inducers: Avoid use ( 2.3 , 7.1 ). 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on NOURIANZ Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Coadministration of NOURIANZ with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (ketoconazole) increased istradefylline AUC inf by 2.5-fold [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Therefore, the recommended maximum dosage of NOURIANZ in patients concomitantly using strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, ketoconazole, clarithromycin) is 20 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Coadministration of NOURIANZ with a strong CYP3A4 inducer (rifampin) decreased istradefylline C max and AUC inf by 45% and 81%, respectively [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Therefore, it is recommended to avoid use of NOURIANZ with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, rifampin, phenytoin, St. John's wort) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 7.2 Effect of NOURIANZ on Other Drugs CYP3A4 Substrates Coadministration of NOURIANZ 20 mg with a CYP3A4 substrate (midazolam) did not affect the CYP3A4 substrate exposure, while concomitant administration of NOURIANZ 40 mg increased the CYP3A4 substrate (atorvastatin) C max and AUC inf by 1.5-fold [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Monitor for an increase in adverse reactions of concomitant drugs that are CYP3A4 substrates when coadministering with NOURIANZ 40 mg. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) Substrates Coadministration of NOURIANZ with a P-gp substrate (digoxin) increased the P-gp substrate C max and AUC inf by 33% and 21%, respectively [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Monitor for an increase in adverse reactions of concomitant drugs that are P-gp substrates when coadministering with NOURIANZ.
