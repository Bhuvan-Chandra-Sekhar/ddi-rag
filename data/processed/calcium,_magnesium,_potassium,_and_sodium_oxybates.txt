=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Concomitant use with divalproex sodium: An initial reduction in XYWAV dose of at least 20% is recommended ( 2.7 , 7.2 ). 7.1 Alcohol, Sedative Hypnotics, and CNS Depressants XYWAV is contraindicated for use in combination with alcohol or sedative hypnotics. Use of other CNS depressants may potentiate the CNS-depressant effects of XYWAV [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 7.2 Divalproex Sodium Concomitant use of sodium oxybate with divalproex sodium results in an increase in systemic exposure to GHB, which was shown to cause a greater impairment on some tests of attention and working memory in a clinical study [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . A similar increase in exposure is expected with concomitant use of XYWAV and divalproex sodium; therefore, an initial dose reduction of XYWAV is recommended when used concomitantly with divalproex sodium [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 )]. Prescribers are advised to monitor patient response closely and adjust dose accordingly if concomitant use of XYWAV and divalproex sodium is warranted.
