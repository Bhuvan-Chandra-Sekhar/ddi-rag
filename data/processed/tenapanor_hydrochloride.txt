7 DRUG INTERACTIONS OATP2B1 Substrates: Potential for reduced exposure of the concomitant drug (e.g., enalapril). Monitor for signs related to loss of efficacy and adjust the dosage of the concomitantly administered drug as needed. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 OATP2B1 Substrates Tenapanor is an inhibitor of intestinal uptake transporter, OATP2B1 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Drugs which are substrates of OATP2B1 may have reduced exposures when concomitantly taken with IBSRELA. Monitor for signs related to loss of efficacy and adjust the dosage of concomitantly administered drug as needed. Enalapril is a substrate of OATP2B1. When enalapril was coadministered with tenapanor (30 mg twice daily for five days, a dosage 0.6 times the recommended dosage), the peak exposure (C max ) of enalapril and its active metabolite, enalaprilat, decreased by approximately 70% and total systemic exposures (AUC) decreased by approximately 50% to 65% compared to when enalapril was administered alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Monitor blood pressure and increase the dosage of enalapril, if needed, when IBSRELA is coadministered with enalapril.
