Drug: isoflurane

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Concomitant use of N 2 O and/or opioids reduces the MAC of Isoflurane USP. Adjust dose accordingly. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) • Isoflurane USP decreases the doses of neuromuscular blocking agents required. Adjust dose accordingly. ( 7.3 ) 7.1 Opioids Opioids decrease the Minimum Alveolar Concentration (MAC) of isoflurane. Opioids such as fentanyl and its analogues, when combined with isoflurane, may lead to a synergistic fall in blood pressure and respiratory rate. 7.2 Nitrous Oxide Nitrous oxide decreases the MAC of isoflurane [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. 7.3 Neuromuscular Blocking Agents Isoflurane potentiates the muscle relaxant effect of all neuromuscular blocking agents and decreases the required doses of neuromuscular blocking agents. In general, anesthetic concentrations isoflurane at equilibrium reduce the ED 95 of succinylcholine, atracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium by approximately 25 to 40% or more compared to N 2 O/opioid anesthesia. If added relaxation is required, supplemental doses of neuromuscular blocking agents may be used. 7.4 Adrenaline Isoflurane is similar to sevoflurane in the sensitization of the myocardium to arrhythmogenic effect of exogenously administered adrenaline. Doses of adrenaline greater than 5mcg/kg, whenvadministered submucosally may produce multiple ventricular arrhythmias. 7.5 Calcium Antagonists Isoflurane may lead to marked hypotension in patients treated with calcium antagonists. 7.6 Concomitant use with Beta Blockers Concomitant use of beta blockers may exaggerate the cardiovascular effects of inhalational anesthetics, including hypotension and negative inotropic effects. 7.7 Concomitant Use with MAO Inhibitors Concomitant use of MAO inhibitors and inhalational anesthetics may increase the risk of hemodynamic instability during surgery or medical procedures.
