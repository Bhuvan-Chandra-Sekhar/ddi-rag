7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Chelation Agents: Antacids, Sucralfate, Metal Cations, Multivitamins Fluoroquinolones form chelates with alkaline earth and transition metal cations. Oral administration of BAXDELA with antacids containing aluminum or magnesium, with sucralfate, with metal cations such as iron, or with multivitamins containing iron or zinc, or with formulations containing divalent and trivalent cations such as didanosine buffered tablets for oral suspension or the pediatric powder for oral solution, may substantially interfere with the absorption of BAXDELA, resulting in systemic concentrations considerably lower than desired. Therefore, BAXDELA should be taken at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after these agents [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . There are no data concerning an interaction of intravenous BAXDELA with oral antacids, sucralfate, multivitamins, didanosine, or metal cations. However, BAXDELA should not be co-administered with any solution containing multivalent cations, e.g., magnesium, through the same intravenous line [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] .
