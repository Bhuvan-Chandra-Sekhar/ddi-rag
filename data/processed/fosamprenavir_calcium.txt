=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Coadministration of fosamprenavir with drugs that induce CYP3A4 may decrease amprenavir (active metabolite) concentrations leading to potential loss of virologic activity. ( 7 , 12.3 ) • Coadministration with drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 may increase amprenavir concentrations. ( 7 , 12.3 ) • Coadministration of fosamprenavir or fosamprenavir and ritonavir may result in clinically significant interactions with drugs metabolized by CYP3A4. ( 7 ) • Coadministration of fosamprenavir and ritonavir may result in clinically significant interactions with drugs metabolized by CYP2D6. ( 7 ) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibitors and Inducers Amprenavir, the active metabolite of fosamprenavir, is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 metabolism and therefore should not be administered concurrently with medications with narrow therapeutic windows that are substrates of CYP3A4. Data also suggest that amprenavir induces CYP3A4. Amprenavir is metabolized by CYP3A4. Coadministration of fosamprenavir and drugs that induce CYP3A4, such as rifampin, may decrease amprenavir concentrations and reduce its therapeutic effect. Coadministration of fosamprenavir and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 may increase amprenavir concentrations and increase the incidence of adverse effects. The potential for drug interactions with fosamprenavir changes when fosamprenavir is coadministered with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ritonavir. The magnitude of CYP3A4-mediated drug interactions (effect on amprenavir or effect on coadministered drug) may change when fosamprenavir is coadministered with ritonavir. Because ritonavir is a CYP2D6 inhibitor, clinically significant interactions with drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 are possible when coadministered with fosamprenavir plus ritonavir. Ritonavir also appears to induce CYP3A, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2B6, as well as other enzymes, including glucuronosyl transferase. There are other agents that may result in serious and/or life-threatening drug interactions [see Contraindications (4) ] . 7.2 Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions If fosamprenavir is used in combination with ritonavir, see full prescribing information for ritonavir for additional information on drug interactions [see Contraindications (4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Table 6 provides a listing of established or potentially clinically significant drug interactions.

Antimycobacterial: Rifampin a ↓ Amprenavir Coadministration is contraindicated as it may lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to fosamprenavir or to the class of protease inhibitors [see Contraindications (4)] . Antineoplastics: Dasatinib, nilotinib, ibrutinib, vinblastine, everolimus ↑ Antineoplastics Fosamprenavir or fosamprenavir/ritonavir may increase plasma concentrations of antineoplastics metabolized by CYP3A, potentially increasing the risk of adverse events typically associated with these medications. In case of coadministration, please refer to relevant prescribing information for these medications. Antipsychotics: Lurasidone ↑ Lurasidone Fosamprenavir: If coadministration is necessary, reduce the lurasidone dose.

Quetiapine ↑ Quetiapine Fosamprenavir/ritonavir: Initiation of fosamprenavir with ritonavir in patients taking quetiapine: Consider alternative antiretroviral therapy to avoid increases in quetiapine drug exposures. If coadministration is necessary, reduce the quetiapine dose to 1/6 of the current dose and monitor for quetiapine-associated adverse reactions.

Inhaled beta-agonist: Salmeterol ↑ Salmeterol Concurrent administration of salmeterol with fosamprenavir is not recommended.

Inhaled/nasal steroid: Fluticasone Fosamprenavir: ↑ Fluticasone Fosamprenavir/ ritonavir: ↑ Fluticasone Use with caution. Consider alternatives to fluticasone, particularly for long-term use. May result in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations. Systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal suppression have been reported during postmarketing use in patients receiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasally administered fluticasone. Coadministration of fluticasone and fosamprenavir/ritonavir is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. Lipid Modifying Agents: HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors: Atorvastatin a ↑ Atorvastatin Titrate atorvastatin dose carefully and use the lowest necessary dose; do not exceed atorvastatin 20 mg/day. Lovastatin, simvastatin ↑ Lovastatin ↑ Simvastatin Coadministration with lovastatin or simvastatin is contraindicated due to potential for serious reactions such as risk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis [see Contraindications (4) ] . Other lipid modifying agents: Lomitapide ↑ Lomitapide Coadministration with lomitapide is contraindicated due to potential for markedly increased transaminases. Narcotic analgesic: Methadone ↓ Methadone Data suggest that the interaction is not clinically relevant; however, patients should be monitored for opiate withdrawal symptoms. Fentanyl ↑ Fentanyl Careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and adverse effects of fentanyl (including potentially fatal respiratory depression) is recommended. Oral contraceptives: Ethinyl estradiol/norethindrone Fosamprenavir: ↓ Amprenavir ↓ Ethinyl estradiol Alternative methods of non-hormonal contraception are recommended. May lead to loss of virologic response. Fosamprenavir/ ritonavir: ↓ Ethinyl estradiol Increased risk of transaminase elevations. No data are available on the use of fosamprenavir/ritonavir with other hormonal therapies, such as hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for postmenopausal women. PDE5 inhibitors: Sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil ↑ Sildenafil ↑ Tadalafil ↑ Vardenafil May result in an increase in PDE5 inhibitor-associated adverse events, including hypotension, syncope, visual disturbances, and priapism. Use of PDE5 inhibitors for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH): Use of sildenafil (REVATIO) is contraindicated when used for the treatment of PAH. A safe and effective dose has not been established when used with fosamprenavir. There is increased potential for sildenafil-associated adverse events (which include visual disturbances, hypotension, prolonged erection, and syncope) [see Contraindications (4) ] . • The following dose adjustments are recommended for use of tadalafil (ADCIRCA ® ) with fosamprenavir: Coadministration of ADCIRCA in patients on fosamprenavir: In patients receiving fosamprenavir for at least one week, start ADCIRCA at 20 mg once daily. Increase to 40 mg once daily based upon individual tolerability. Coadministration of fosamprenavir in patients on ADCIRCA: Avoid use of ADCIRCA during the initiation of fosamprenavir. Stop ADCIRCA at least 24 hours prior to starting fosamprenavir. After at least one week following the initiation of fosamprenavir, resume ADCIRCA at 20 mg once daily.

Tricyclic antidepressants: Amitriptyline, imipramine ↑ Tricyclics Therapeutic concentration monitoring is recommended for tricyclic antidepressants.
Drug Interaction Studies [See Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7) .] Amprenavir, the active metabolite of fosamprenavir, is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Amprenavir inhibits CYP3A4. Data also suggest that amprenavir induces CYP3A4. Caution should be used when coadministering medications that are substrates, inhibitors, or inducers of CYP3A4, or potentially toxic medications that are metabolized by CYP3A4. Amprenavir does not inhibit CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, or uridine glucuronosyltransferase (UDPGT). Amprenavir is both a substrate for and inducer of P-glycoprotein. Drug interaction trials were performed with fosamprenavir and other drugs likely to be coadministered or drugs commonly used as probes for pharmacokinetic interactions. The effects of coadministration on AUC, C max , and C min values are summarized in Table 10 (effect of other drugs on amprenavir) and Table 12 (effect of fosamprenavir on other drugs). In addition, since fosamprenavir delivers comparable amprenavir plasma concentrations as AGENERASE, drug interaction data derived from trials with AGENERASE are provided in Tables 11 and 13.
