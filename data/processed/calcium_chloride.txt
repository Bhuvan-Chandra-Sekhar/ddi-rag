=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Digoxin: Avoid concomitant use with calcium chloride injection. If concomitant use is unavoidable, monitor ECG closely during administration of calcium chloride injection. ( 5.3 , 7.1 ) Calcium Channel Blockers: Avoid concomitant use with calcium chloride injection. If concomitant use is unavoidable, monitor blood pressure closely during administration of calcium chloride injection. ( 7.2 ) Drugs That Increase the Risk of Hypercalcemia: Increase the frequency of calcium concentration monitoring in patients taking calcium chloride injection concomitantly with other drugs that increase the risk of hypercalcemia. ( 7.3 ) 7.1 Digoxin Avoid the concomitant use of calcium chloride injection with digoxin. If concomitant use is unavoidable, monitor ECG closely during administration of calcium chloride injection. Synergistic arrhythmias may occur with concomitant use. The use of calcium chloride injection may result in hypercalcemia which increases the risk of digoxin toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 7.2 Calcium Channel Blockers Concomitant use of calcium chloride injection and calcium channel blockers may reduce the response to calcium channel blockers. Avoid concomitant use. If concomitant use is unavoidable, monitor blood pressure closely during administration of calcium chloride injection. 7.3 Drugs That Increase the Risk of Hypercalcemia Increase frequency of monitoring of calcium concentrations in patients taking concomitant calcium chloride injection and other drugs that increase the risk of hypercalcemia (e.g., calcipotriene, estrogen, lithium, parathyroid hormone, teriparatide, thiazide diuretics, Vitamin A and Vitamin D).
