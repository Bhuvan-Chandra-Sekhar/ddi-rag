Drug: riluzole

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong to moderate CYP1A2 inhibitors: Co-administration may increase TIGLUTIK-associated adverse reactions ( 7.1 ) Strong to moderate CYP1A2 inducers: Co-administration may result in decreased efficacy ( 7.2 ) Hepatotoxic drugs: TIGLUTIK-treated patients that take other hepatotoxic drugs may be at increased risk for hepatotoxicity ( 7.3 ) 7.1 Agents that may Increase Riluzole Blood Concentrations CYP1A2 Inhibitors Co-administration of riluzole (a CYP1A substrate) with CYP1A2 inhibitors was not evaluated in a clinical trial; however, in vitro findings suggest an increase in riluzole exposure is likely. The concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, fluvoxamine, methoxsalen, mexiletine, oral contraceptives, thiabendazole, vemurafenib, zileuton) with TIGLUTIK may increase the risk of TIGLUTIK - associated adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Agents that may Decrease Riluzole Plasma Concentrations CYP1A2 Inducers Co-administration of riluzole (a CYP1A substrate) with CYP1A2 inducers was not evaluated in a clinical trial; however, in vitro findings suggest a decrease in riluzole exposure is likely. Lower exposures may result in decreased efficacy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.3 Hepatotoxic Drugs Clinical trials in ALS patients excluded patients on concomitant medications which were potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., allopurinol, methyldopa, sulfasalazine). TIGLUTIK-treated patients who take other hepatotoxic drugs may be at an increased risk for hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ].
