7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Dose adjustments due to drug interactions ( 2.4 , 7.1 ): Factors Dose Adjustments for INGREZZA and INGREZZA SPRINKLE Use of MAOIs with INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE Avoid concomitant use with MAOIs. Use of strong CYP3A4 inducers with INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE Concomitant use is not recommended. Use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE Recommended dosage is 40 mg once daily. Use of strong CYP2D6 inhibitors with INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE Recommended dosage is 40 mg once daily. 7.1 Drugs Having Clinically Important Interactions with INGREZZA and INGREZZA SPRINKLE Table 3: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with INGREZZA and INGREZZA SPRINKLE Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Clinical Implication: Concomitant use of INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE with MAOIs may increase the concentration of monoamine neurotransmitters in synapses, potentially leading to increased risk of adverse reactions such as serotonin syndrome, or attenuated treatment effect of INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE. Prevention or Management: Avoid concomitant use of INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE with MAOIs, or within 14 days of discontinuing therapy with an MAOI. Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Clinical Implication: Concomitant use of INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increased the exposure (C max and AUC) to valbenazine and its active metabolite compared with the use of INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE alone [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Increased exposure of valbenazine and its active metabolite may increase the risk of exposure-related adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. Prevention or Management: Reduce INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE dose when INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE is coadministered with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. Strong CYP2D6 Inhibitors Clinical Implication: Concomitant use of INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE with strong CYP2D6 inhibitors increased the exposure (C max and AUC) to valbenazine’s active metabolite compared with the use of INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE alone [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 , 12.5 )] . Increased exposure of active metabolite may increase the risk of exposure-related adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. Prevention or Management: Reduce INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE dose when INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE is coadministered with a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Clinical Implication: Concomitant use of INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE with a strong CYP3A4 inducer decreased the exposure of valbenazine and its active metabolite compared to the use of INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE alone. Reduced exposure of valbenazine and its active metabolite may reduce efficacy [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Prevention or Management: Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers with INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. Digoxin Clinical Implication: Concomitant use of INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE with digoxin increased digoxin levels because of inhibition of intestinal P-glycoprotein (P-gp) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Prevention or Management: Digoxin concentrations should be monitored when co-administering INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE with digoxin. Increased digoxin exposure may increase the risk of exposure-related adverse reactions. Dosage adjustment of digoxin may be necessary.
