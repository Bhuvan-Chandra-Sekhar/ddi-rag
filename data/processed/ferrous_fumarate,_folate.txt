=== Drug Interactions ===
Drug Interactions: Finazol™ is not recommended for and should not be given to patients receiving levodopa because the action of levodopa is antagonized by pyridoxine. There is a possibility of increased bleeding due to pyridoxine interaction with anticoagulants (e.g., Aspirin, Heparin or Clopidogrel).
