Drug: cysteamine_bitartrate

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Drugs that Increase Gastric pH Drugs that increase the gastric pH (e.g., medications containing bicarbonate or carbonate) may alter the pharmacokinetics of cysteamine due to the premature release of cysteamine from PROCYSBI and increase WBC cystine concentration. Concomitant administration of 20 mg omeprazole did not affect the pharmacokinetics of cysteamine when PROCYSBI was administered with 240 mL of orange juice or with 240 mL of water [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Monitor WBC cystine concentration when drugs that increase the gastric pH are concomitantly used [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. 7.2 Use with Alcohol Consumption of alcohol with PROCYSBI may increase the rate of cysteamine release and/or adversely alter the pharmacokinetic properties, as well as the effectiveness and safety of PROCYSBI. Therefore, do not consume alcoholic beverages during treatment with PROCYSBI [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. 7.3 Other Medications Used for the Management of Fanconi Syndrome PROCYSBI can be administered with other electrolyte and mineral replacements necessary for management of Fanconi syndrome, as well as vitamin D and thyroid hormone.
