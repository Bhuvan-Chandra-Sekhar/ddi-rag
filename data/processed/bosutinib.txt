Drug: bosutinib

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Strong and Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors: Avoid concomitant use with BOSULIF. ( 7.1 ) • Strong CYP3A Inducers: Avoid concomitant use with BOSULIF. ( 7.1 ) • Proton Pump Inhibitors: Use short-acting antacids or H2 blockers as an alternative to proton pump inhibitors. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on BOSULIF Strong or Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Avoid the concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors with BOSULIF. Bosutinib is a CYP3A substrate. Concomitant use with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor increases bosutinib C max and AUC [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] which may increase the risk of toxicities. Strong CYP3A Inducers Avoid the concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers with BOSULIF. Bosutinib is a CYP3A substrate. Concomitant use with a strong CYP3A inducer decreases bosutinib C max and AUC [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] which may reduce BOSULIF efficacy. Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPI) As an alternative to PPIs, use short-acting antacids or H2 blockers and separate dosing by more than 2 hours from BOSULIF dosing. Bosutinib displays pH dependent aqueous solubility, Concomitant use with a PPI decreases bosutinib C max and AUC [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] which may reduce BOSULIF efficacy.
