=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Reduce NUPLAZID dose to 10 mg once daily. ( 2.3 , 7.1 ) Strong or Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers: Avoid concomitant use of NUPLAZID. ( 2.3 , 7.1 ) 7.1 Drugs Having Clinically Important Interactions with NUPLAZID Table 2 Clinically Important Drug Interactions with NUPLAZID QT Interval Prolongation Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of drugs that prolong the QT interval may add to the QT effects of NUPLAZID and increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmia. Intervention: Avoid the use of NUPLAZID in combination with other drugs known to prolong QT interval (e.g., Class 1A antiarrythmics, Class 3 antiarrythmics, certain antipsychotics or antibiotics) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of NUPLAZID with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor increases pimavanserin exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Intervention: If NUPLAZID is used with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, reduce the dosage of NUPLAZID [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Strong or Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of NUPLAZID with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers reduces pimavanserin exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Intervention: Avoid concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers with NUPLAZID [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 7.2 Drugs Having No Clinically Important Interactions with NUPLAZID Based on pharmacokinetic studies, no dosage adjustment of carbidopa/levodopa is required when administered concomitantly with NUPLAZID [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .
