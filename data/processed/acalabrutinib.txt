Drug: acalabrutinib

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Strong CYP3A Inhibitors : Avoid co-administration with CALQUENCE. ( 2.2 , 7 ) • Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors : Reduce the dosage of CALQUENCE. ( 2.2 , 7 ) • Strong CYP3A Inducers : Avoid co-administration with CALQUENCE. If co-administration is unavoidable, increase the dosage of CALQUENCE. ( 2.2 , 7 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on CALQUENCE Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Clinical Effect Co-administration of CALQUENCE with a strong CYP3A inhibitor increased acalabrutinib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Increased acalabrutinib concentrations may result in increased toxicity. Prevention or Management Avoid co-administration of CALQUENCE with strong CYP3A inhibitors. Alternatively, if the inhibitor will be used short-term, interrupt CALQUENCE [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Clinical Effect Co-administration of CALQUENCE with a moderate CYP3A inhibitor may increase acalabrutinib plasma concentration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Increased acalabrutinib concentrations may result in increased toxicity. Prevention or Management Reduce the dosage of CALQUENCE when co-administered with a moderate CYP3A inhibitor [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Strong CYP3A Inducers Clinical Effect Co-administration of CALQUENCE with a strong CYP3A inducer decreased acalabrutinib plasma concentration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Decreased acalabrutinib concentrations may reduce CALQUENCE activity. Prevention or Management Avoid co-administration of CALQUENCE with strong CYP3A inducers. If co-administration is unavoidable, increase the dosage of CALQUENCE [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ].
