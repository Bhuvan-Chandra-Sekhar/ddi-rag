=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Effect of Other Drugs on LEQSELVI Strong CYP3A and moderate or strong CYP2C9 inducers: Avoid concomitant use of LEQSELVI with strong CYP3A and moderate or strong CYP2C9 inducers. Deuruxolitinib is a CYP2C9 and CYP3A substrate. Concomitant use with a strong CYP3A and moderate or strong CYP2C9 inducer decreases deuruxolitinib exposure (C max and AUC), which may reduce LEQSELVI efficacy [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Moderate or strong CYP2C9 inhibitors: LEQSELVI is contraindicated in patients taking moderate or strong CYP2C9 inhibitors [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Deuruxolitinib is a CYP2C9 substrate. Concomitant use with a moderate or strong CYP2C9 inhibitor is estimated to increase deuruxolitinib exposure (C max and AUC), which may increase the risk of LEQSELVI serious adverse reactions such as thrombosis [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Strong CYP3A4 and moderate or strong CYP2C9 inducers: Avoid concomitant use. ( 7 ) Moderate or strong CYP2C9 inhibitors: Contraindicated. ( 7 )
