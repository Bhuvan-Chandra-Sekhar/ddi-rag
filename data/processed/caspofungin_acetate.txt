=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Cyclosporine: In two adult clinical studies, cyclosporine (one 4 mg/kg dose or two 3 mg/kg doses) increased the AUC of CANCIDAS. CANCIDAS did not increase the plasma levels of cyclosporine. There were transient increases in liver ALT and AST when CANCIDAS and cyclosporine were co-administered . Monitor patients who develop abnormal liver enzymes during concomitant therapy and evaluate the risk/benefit of continuing therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Tacrolimus: For patients receiving CANCIDAS and tacrolimus, standard monitoring of tacrolimus trough whole blood concentrations and appropriate tacrolimus dosage adjustments are recommended. Inducers of Hepatic CYP Enzymes Rifampin: Rifampin is a potent CYP3A4 inducer and concomitant administration with CANCIDAS is expected to reduce the plasma concentrations of CANCIDAS. Therefore, adult patients on rifampin should receive 70 mg of CANCIDAS daily and pediatric patients on rifampin should receive 70 mg/m 2 of CANCIDAS daily (not to exceed an actual daily dose of 70 mg) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Other Inducers of Hepatic CYP Enzymes Adults: When CANCIDAS is co-administered to adult patients with other inducers of hepatic CYP enzymes, such as efavirenz, nevirapine, phenytoin, dexamethasone, or carbamazepine, administration of a daily dose of 70 mg of CANCIDAS should be considered [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Pediatric Patients: When CANCIDAS is co-administered to pediatric patients with other inducers of hepatic CYP enzymes, such as efavirenz, nevirapine, phenytoin, dexamethasone, or carbamazepine, administration of a daily dose of 70 mg/m 2 CANCIDAS (not to exceed an actual daily dose of 70 mg) should be considered [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .
