=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Non-Selective Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) Inhibitors Both ONGENTYS and non-selective MAO inhibitors (e.g., phenelzine, isocarboxazid, and tranylcypromine) inhibit catecholamine metabolism, leading to increased levels of catecholamines. Concomitant use may increase the risk of possible arrhythmias, increased heart rate, and excessive changes in blood pressure. Concomitant use of ONGENTYS with non-selective MAO inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Selective MAO-B inhibitors can be used concomitantly with ONGENTYS. 7.2 Effect of ONGENTYS on Other Drugs Drugs Metabolized by Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT) Concomitant use of ONGENTYS with drugs metabolized by COMT may affect the pharmacokinetics of those drugs, which may increase the risk of possible arrhythmias, increased heart rate, and excessive changes in blood pressure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Drugs known to be metabolized by COMT should be administered with caution. Monitor for changes in heart rate, rhythm, and blood pressure in patients concomitantly treated with ONGENTYS and drugs metabolized by COMT [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] .
