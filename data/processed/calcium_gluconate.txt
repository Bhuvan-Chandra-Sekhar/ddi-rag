Drug: calcium_gluconate

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Cardiac Glycoside: Synergistic arrhythmias may occur if calcium and cardiac glycosides are administered together. ( 7.1 ) Calcium Channel Blockers : Administration of calcium may reduce the response. ( 7.2 ) Drugs that may cause hypercalcemia: Vitamin D, vitamin A, thiazide diuretics, estrogen, calcipotriene and teriparatide administration may cause hypercalcemia. Monitor plasma calcium concentrations in patients taking these drugs concurrently. ( 7.3 ) 7.1 Cardiac Glycosides Hypercalcemia increases the risk of digoxin toxicity, while digoxin may be therapeutically ineffective in the presence of hypocalcemia. Synergistic arrhythmias may occur if calcium and cardiac glycosides are administered together. Avoid administration of Calcium Gluconate Injection in patients receiving cardiac glycosides; if considered necessary, administer Calcium Gluconate Injection slowly in small amounts and monitor ECG closely during administration. 7.2 Calcium Channel Blockers Administration of calcium may reduce the response to calcium channel blockers. 7.3 Drugs that may cause Hypercalcemia Vitamin D, vitamin A, thiazide diuretics, estrogen, calcipotriene and teriparatide administration may cause hypercalcemia. Monitor plasma calcium concentrations in patients taking these drugs concurrently.
