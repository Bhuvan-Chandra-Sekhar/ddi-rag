=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Eribulin Mesylate No drug-drug interactions are expected with CYP3A4 inhibitors, CYP3A4 inducers or P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors. Clinically meaningful differences in exposure (AUC) were not observed in patients with advanced solid tumors when eribulin mesylate was administered with or without ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 and a P-gp inhibitor) and when eribulin mesylate was administered with or without rifampin (a CYP3A4 inducer) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.2 Effects of Eribulin Mesylate on Other Drugs Eribulin does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 or CYP3A4 enzymes or induce CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 enzymes at relevant clinical concentrations. Eribulin is not expected to alter the plasma concentrations of drugs that are substrates of these enzymes [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )].
