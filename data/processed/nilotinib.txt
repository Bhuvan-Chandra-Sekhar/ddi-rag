Drug: nilotinib

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Strong CYP3A Inhibitors : Avoid concomitant use with DANZITEN or reduce DANZITEN dose if concomitant use cannot be avoided. ( 7.1 ) • Strong CYP3A Inducers : Avoid concomitant use with DANZITEN. ( 7.1 ) • Proton Pump Inhibitors : Use short-acting antacids or H2 blockers as an alternative to proton pump inhibitors. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on DANZITEN Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors with DANZITEN. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, reduce DANZITEN dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.9 )] . Nilotinib is a CYP3A substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Concomitant use with a strong CYP3A inhibitor increases nilotinib exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may increase the risk of DANZITEN adverse reactions. Strong CYP3A Inducers Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers with DANZITEN. Nilotinib is a CYP3A substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Concomitant use with a strong CYP3A inducer decreases nilotinib exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may reduce DANZITEN efficacy. Proton Pump Inhibitors Avoid concomitant use of PPI with DANZITEN. As an alternative to PPIs, use H 2 blockers approximately 10 hours before or approximately 2 hours after the dose of DANZITEN, or use antacids approximately 2 hours before or approximately 2 hours after the dose of DANZITEN. Nilotinib displays pH-dependent aqueous solubility [see Description ( 11 )] . Concomitant use with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) decreases nilotinib concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may reduce DANZITEN efficacy. 7.2 Drugs that Prolong the QT Interval Avoid coadministration of DANZITEN with agents that may prolong the QT interval, such as anti-arrhythmic drugs [see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )]. Nilotinib is associated with a clinically significant concentration-dependent QT prolongation [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )].
