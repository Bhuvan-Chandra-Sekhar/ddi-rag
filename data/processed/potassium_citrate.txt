Drug: potassium_citrate

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The following drug interactions may occur with potassium citrate: Potassium-sparing diuretics: concomitant administration should be avoided since the simultaneous administration of these agents can produce severe hyperkalemia (7.1) Drugs that slow gastrointestinal transit time: These agents (such as anticholinergics) can be expected to increase the gastrointestinal irritation produced by potassium salts (7.2) Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors: Monitor for hyperkalemia (7.3) Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) monitor for hyperkalemia (7.4) 7.1 Potential Effects of Potassium Citrate on Other Drugs Potassium-sparing Diuretics: Concomitant administration of potassium citrate and a potassium-sparing diuretic (such as triamterene, spironolactone or amiloride) should be avoided since the simultaneous administration of these agents can produce severe hyperkalemia. 7.2 Potential Effects of Other Drugs on Potassium Citrate Drugs that slow gastrointestinal transit time: These agents (such as anticholinergics) can be expected to increase the gastrointestinal irritation produced by potassium salts. 7.3 Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System Inhibitors Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), spironolactone, eplerenone, or aliskiren produce potassium retention by inhibiting aldosterone production. Closely monitor potassium in patients receiving concomitant RAAS therapy. 7.4 Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) NSAIDs may produce potassium retention by reducing renal synthesis of prostagladin E and impairing the renin-angiotensin system. Closely monitor potassium in patients on concomitant NSAIDs.
