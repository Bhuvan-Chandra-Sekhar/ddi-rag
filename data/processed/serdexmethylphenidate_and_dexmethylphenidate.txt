( 7.1 ) 7.1 Clinically Important Interactions with AZSTARYS Table 1 presents clinically important drug interactions with AZSTARYS. Table 1: Clinically Important Drug Interactions with AZSTARYS Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Clinical Impact Concomitant use of MAOIs and CNS stimulants, including AZSTARYS, can cause hypertensive crisis. Potential outcomes include death, stroke, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, ophthalmological complications, eclampsia, pulmonary edema, and renal failure [see Contraindications ( 4 )] .

Intervention Monitor blood pressure and adjust the dosage of the antihypertensive drug, as needed. Halogenated Anesthetics Clinical Impact Concomitant use of halogenated anesthetics and AZSTARYS may increase the risk of sudden blood pressure and heart rate increase during surgery. Intervention Avoid use of AZSTARYS in patients being treated with anesthetics on the day of surgery. Risperidone Clinical Impact Combined use of methylphenidate with risperidone when there is a change, whether an increase or decrease, in dosage of either or both medications, may increase the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).
