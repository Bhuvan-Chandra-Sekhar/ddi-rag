Drug: ganaxolone

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS UGT inhibitors may increase ganaxolone exposures; consider reduction of a stable ZTALMY dosage when initiating a UGT inhibitor. ( 7.1 ) Cytochrome P450 inducers will decrease ganaxolone exposure. It is recommended to avoid concomitant use with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers; if unavoidable, consider a dosage increase of ZTALMY, but do not exceed the maximum recommended dosage. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effect of UGT Inhibitors on ZTALMY Concomitant use of ZTALMY and UGT inhibitors (e.g., valproic acid) may increase the exposure of ganaxolone, which may increase the risk of ZTALMY associated adverse reactions in patients who have titrated to a stable ZTALMY dosage. Consider a reduction of ZTALMY maintenance dosage when initiating a UGT inhibitor [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Effect of Strong or Moderate Cytochrome P450 Inducers on ZTALMY Coadministration of ZTALMY with CYP450 inducers, such as strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers, will decrease ganaxolone exposure, which can lower the efficacy of ZTALMY [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . It is recommended to avoid concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers with ZTALMY. When concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers is unavoidable, consider an increase in the dosage of ZTALMY; however, do not exceed the maximum daily dosage of ZTALMY [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . In patients on a stable ZTALMY dosage who are initiating or increasing the dosages of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and primidone), the ZTALMY dosage may need to be increased; however, do not exceed the maximum daily dosage of ZTALMY [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . 7.3 Concomitant Use of ZTALMY with CNS Depressants and Alcohol Concomitant use of ZTALMY with CNS depressants, including alcohol, may increase the risk of somnolence and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .
