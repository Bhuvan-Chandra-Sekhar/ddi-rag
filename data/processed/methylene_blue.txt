=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Clinically significant drug interactions with methylene blue are described below: The concomitant use of methylene blue with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome. Although the mechanism is not clearly understood, literature reports suggest methylene blue is a potent reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase. Avoid concomitant use of methylene blue with medicinal products that enhance serotonergic transmission including antidepressants like SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), SNRIs (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), MAOIs (monoamine oxidase inhibitors), bupropion, buspirone, clomipramine, mirtazapine, linezolid, opioids, and dextromethorphan because of the potential for serious CNS reactions, including potentially fatal serotonin syndrome. If the intravenous use of methylene blue cannot be avoided in patients treated with serotonergic medicinal products, choose the lowest possible dose and observe the patient closely for CNS effects for up to 4 hours after administration [see Warning and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].
