7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Anticoagulants, Antiplatelets, Thrombolytics, and Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs): Avoid concomitant use due to increased risk of bleeding. ( 7.1 ) Rifampin: Avoid concomitant use ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Anticoagulants, Antiplatelets, Thrombolytics, and SSRIs/SNRIs Co-administration of anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs, thrombolytics and SSRIs or SNRIs may increase the risk of bleeding. Promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss if patients are treated concomitantly with anticoagulants, aspirin, other platelet aggregation inhibitors, and/or NSAIDs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Long-term concomitant treatment with SAVAYSA and other anticoagulants is not recommended because of increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Short term co-administration may be needed for patients transitioning to or from SAVAYSA [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . In clinical studies with SAVAYSA concomitant use of aspirin (low dose ≤ 100 mg/day) or thienopyridines, and NSAIDs was permitted and resulted in increased rates of Clinically Relevant Bleeding. Carefully monitor for bleeding in patients who require chronic treatment with low dose aspirin and/or NSAIDs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . As with other anticoagulants the possibility may exist that patients are at an increased risk of bleeding in case of concomitant use with SSRIs or SNRIs due to their reported effect on platelets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 7.2 P-gp Inducers Avoid the concomitant use of SAVAYSA with rifampin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.3 P-gp Inhibitors Treatment of NVAF Based on clinical experience from the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 study, dose reduction in patients concomitantly receiving P-gp inhibitors resulted in edoxaban blood levels that were lower than in patients who were given the full dose. Consequently, no dose reduction is recommended for concomitant P-gp inhibitor use [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , and Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]
