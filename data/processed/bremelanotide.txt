Drug: bremelanotide

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS VYLEESI may slow gastric emptying and impact absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. ( 7.1 ) VYLEESI may significantly decrease the systemic exposure of orally-administered naltrexone; avoid use with orally administered naltrexone-containing products intended to treat alcohol or opioid addiction. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effect of VYLEESI on Other Drugs VYLEESI may slow gastric emptying and thus has the potential to reduce the rate and extent of absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. Instruct patients to avoid the use of VYLEESI when taking concomitant oral drugs that are dependent on threshold concentrations for efficacy (e.g., antibiotics). In addition, patients should consider discontinuing VYLEESI if there is a delayed drug effect of concomitant oral medications when a quick onset of drug effect is desired (e.g. drugs for pain relief such as indomethacin). 7.2 Naltrexone As VYLEESI may significantly decrease the systemic exposure of orally-administered naltrexone, patients should avoid using VYLEESI with an orally administered naltrexone-containing product that is intended to treat alcohol and opioid addiction due to the severe consequence of naltrexone treatment failure [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ].
