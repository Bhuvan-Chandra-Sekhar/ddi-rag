Drug: praziquantel

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Moderate CYP 3A Inducers : Avoid concomitant administration of moderate CYP 3A inducers, for example, efavirenz ( 5.6 , 7.1 ) 7.1 CYP 3A Inducers Strong and Moderate CYP 3A Inducers Concomitant administration of praziquantel with Strong and Moderate CYP 3A inducers decrease praziquantel AUC and C max [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] which may reduce the efficacy of praziquantel. Concomitant administration of a Strong CYP 3A inducer, such as rifampin, with praziquantel is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) ]. Concomitant administration of a Moderate CYP 3A inducer, such as efavirenz, should be avoided unless the benefit outweighs the risks [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .] 7.2 CYP450 Inhibitors Concomitant administration of drugs that decrease the activity of drug metabolizing liver enzymes (CYP450 inhibitors), for example, cimetidine, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, and ritonavir may increase plasma concentrations of praziquantel. In addition, grapefruit juice was also reported to produce a 1.6-fold increase in the C max and a 1.9-fold increase in the AUC of praziquantel. The effect of this exposure increase on the safety of praziquantel has not been systematically evaluated [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ].
