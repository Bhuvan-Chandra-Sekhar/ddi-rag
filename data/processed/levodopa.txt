=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Monitor patients on MAO-B inhibitors for orthostatic hypotension ( 7.1 ) Dopamine D2 antagonists, isoniazid, and iron salts: May reduce the effectiveness of INBRIJA ( 7.2 , 7.3 ) 7.1 Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) Inhibitors The use of nonselective MAO inhibitors with INBRIJA is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) ] . Discontinue use of any nonselective MAO inhibitors at least two weeks prior to initiating INBRIJA. The use of selective MAO-B inhibitors with INBRIJA may be associated with orthostatic hypotension. Monitor patients who are taking these drugs concurrently. 7.2 Dopamine D2 Receptor Antagonists and Isoniazid Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists (e.g., phenothiazines, butyrophenones, risperidone, metoclopramide) and isoniazid may reduce the effectiveness of levodopa. Monitor patients for worsening Parkinson's symptoms. 7.3 Iron Salts Iron salts or multivitamins containing iron salts can form chelates with levodopa and consequently reduce the bioavailability of levodopa.
