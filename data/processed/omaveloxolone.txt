Drug: omaveloxolone

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Moderate or Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Avoid concomitant use. Consider SKYCLARYS dosage reduction with monitoring if use is unavoidable. ( 2.4 , 7.1 ) Moderate or Strong CYP3A4 Inducers: Avoid concomitant use. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on SKYCLARYS CYP3A4 Inhibitors Omaveloxolone is a CYP3A4 substrate. Concomitant use of SKYCLARYS with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is expected to result in clinically significant increased exposure of omaveloxolone [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )], which may increase the risk of adverse reactions. Avoid concomitant use of SKYCLARYS with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. If use cannot be avoided, dosage modifications are recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. CYP3A4 Inducers Omaveloxolone is a CYP3A4 substrate. Concomitant use of SKYCLARYS with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inducers is expected to result in clinically significant decreased exposure of omaveloxolone [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may reduce the effectiveness of SKYCLARYS. Avoid concomitant use of SKYCLARYS with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inducers. 7.2 Effect of SKYCLARYS on Other Drugs CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 Substrates Omaveloxolone is a weak inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP2C8. Concomitant use with SKYCLARYS can reduce the exposure of CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 substrates which may reduce the activity of these substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Refer to the prescribing information of substrates of CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 for dosing instructions if used concomitantly with SKYCLARYS and monitor for lack of efficacy of the concomitant treatment. Hormonal Contraceptives Omaveloxolone is a weak CYP3A4 inducer [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Concomitant use with SKYCLARYS may reduce the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives. Advise patients to avoid concomitant use with combined hormonal contraceptives (e.g., pill, patch, ring), implants, and progestin only pills [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.3 )] .
