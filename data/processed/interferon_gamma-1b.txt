Drug: interferon_gamma-1b

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of drugs with neurotoxic, hematotoxic or cardiotoxic effects may increase the toxicity of interferons. ( 7.2 ) Avoid simultaneous administration of ACTIMMUNE with other heterologous serum protein or immunological preparations (e.g., vaccines). ( 7.3 ) 7.1 Myelosuppressive Agents When administering ACTIMMUNE in combination with other potentially myelosuppressive agents, monitor neutrophil and platelet counts [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 7.2 Drugs with Neurotoxic, Hematoxic or Cardiotoxic Effects The concurrent use of drugs having neurotoxic (including effects on the central nervous system), hematotoxic, or cardiotoxic effects may increase the toxicity of interferons in these systems. It is theoretically possible that hepatotoxic and/or nephrotoxic drugs might have an effect on the clearance of ACTIMMUNE. 7.3 Immunological Preparations Simultaneous administration of ACTIMMUNE with other heterologous serum protein preparations or immunological preparations (e.g., vaccines) should be avoided due to the risk of an unexpected, or amplified, immune response. 7.4 Effects on Cytochrome P-450 Pathways Preclinical studies in rodents using species-specific interferon gamma have demonstrated a decrease in hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450 concentrations. This could potentially lead to a depression of the hepatic metabolism of certain drugs that utilize this degradative pathway.
