7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Certain OCT2, MATE1, and MATE-2K substrates: Avoid concomitant use with certain OCT2, MATE1, and MATE-2K substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious or life-threatening toxicities. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Effect of COSELA on Other Drugs, Certain OCT2, MATE1, and MATE-2K Substrates COSELA is an inhibitor of OCT2, MATE1, and MATE-2K. Co-administration of COSELA may increase the concentration or net accumulation of OCT2, MATE1, and MATE-2K substrates in the kidney (e.g., dofetilide, dalfampridine, and cisplatin) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Refer to the prescribing information for these concomitant medications for assessing the benefit and risk of concomitant use of COSELA. Table 4: Potentially Significant Drug Interactions with COSELA Drugs Recommendations Comments Dofetilide The potential benefits of taking COSELA concurrently with dofetilide should be considered against the risk of QT interval prolongation. Increased dofetilide blood levels may occur in patients who are also receiving COSELA. Increased plasma concentrations of dofetilide may cause serious ventricular arrhythmias associated with QT interval prolongation, including torsade de pointes. Dalfampridine The potential benefits of taking COSELA concurrently with dalfampridine should be considered against the risk of seizures in these patients. Increased dalfampridine blood levels may occur in patients who are also receiving COSELA. Elevated levels of dalfampridine increase the risk of seizure. Cisplatin Closely monitor for nephrotoxicity. Concurrent treatment with COSELA may increase the exposure and alter the net accumulation of cisplatin in the kidney, which may associate with dose-related nephrotoxicity.
