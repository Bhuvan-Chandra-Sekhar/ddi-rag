Drug: pentoxifylline

=== Drug Interactions ===
Drug Interactions Bleeding has been reported in patients treated with Pentoxifylline Extended-Release Tablets with or without concomitant NSAIDS, anticoagulants, or platelet aggregation inhibitors. Increased prothrombin time has been reports in patients concomitantly treated with pentoxifylline and vitamin K antagonists. Monitoring of anticoagulant activity in these patients is recommended when pentoxifylline is introduced or the dose is changed. Concomitant administration of pentoxifylline- and theophylline-containing drugs leads to increased theophylline levels and theophylline toxicity in some individuals. Monitor theophylline levels when starting Pentoxifylline Extended-Release Tablets or changing dose. Concomitant administration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (including e.g. ciprofloxacin or fluvoxamine) may increase the exposure to pentoxifylline (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Pentoxifylline has been used concurrently with antihypertensive drugs, beta blockers, digitalis, diuretics, and antiarrhythmics, without observed problems. Small decreases in blood pressure have been observed in some patients treated with pentoxifylline; periodic systemic blood pressure monitoring is recommended for patients receiving concomitant antihypertensive therapy. If indicated, dosage of the antihypertensive agents should be reduced. Postmarketing cases of increased anticoagulant activity have been reported in patients concomitantly treated with pentoxifylline and vitamin K antagonists. Monitoring of anticoagulant activity in these patients is recommended when pentoxifylline is introduced or the dose is changed. Concomitant administration with cimetidine is reported to increase the average steady state plasma concentration of pentoxifylline (~ 25%) and Metabolite I (~ 30%).
