Drug: aldesleukin

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drug interaction studies with Proleukin have not been conducted. The drug interaction information described below have been observed post-marketing. See Full Prescribing Information for important drug interactions. ( 7 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on Proleukin Glucocorticoids Avoid concomitant use of glucocorticoids. Coadministration with glucocorticoids may reduce aldesleukin antitumor effectiveness. 7.2 Effect of Proleukin on Other Drugs Radiographic Iodinated Contrast Media Monitor for delayed adverse reactions in patients receiving iodinated contrast media following Proleukin. Administration of radiographic iodinated contrast media following administration of interleukin-2 resulted in acute, atypical adverse reactions that resemble the immediate side effects caused by Proleukin in some patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Effect on Cytochrome P-450 Substrates For certain CYP substrates, minimal changes in the concentration may lead to serious adverse reactions. Monitor for toxicity or drug concentration changes of such CYP substrates when co-administered with Proleukin. Aldesleukin causes release of cytokines [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] that may suppress activity of CYP enzymes, resulting in increased exposure of CYP substrates.
