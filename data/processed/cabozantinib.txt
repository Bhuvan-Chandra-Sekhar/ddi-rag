Drug: cabozantinib

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Reduce the COMETRIQ dosage. ( 2.2 , 7.1 ) Strong CYP3A4 Inducers: Increase the COMETRIQ dosage. ( 2.2 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Effect of CYP3A4 Inhibitors Administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole to healthy subjects increased single-dose plasma cabozantinib exposure by 38%. Avoid taking a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, voriconazole) while taking COMETRIQ or reduce the dosage of COMETRIQ if concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors cannot be avoided [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Avoid ingestion of foods (e.g., grapefruit, grapefruit juice) or nutritional supplements that are known to inhibit cytochrome P450 while taking COMETRIQ. 7.2 Effect of CYP3A4 Inducers Administration of a strong CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin to healthy subjects decreased single-dose plasma cabozantinib exposure by 77%. Avoid chronic co-administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, St. John’s Wort) with COMETRIQ or increase the dosage of COMETRIQ if concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inducers cannot be avoided [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.3 Effect of MRP2 Inhibitors Concomitant administration of MRP2 inhibitors may increase the exposure to cabozantinib. Monitor patients for increased toxicity when MRP2 inhibitors (e.g., abacavir, adefovir, cidofovir, furosemide, lamivudine, nevirapine, ritonavir, probenecid, saquinavir, and tenofovir) are co-administered with COMETRIQ [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] .
