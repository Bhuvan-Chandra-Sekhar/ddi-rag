Drug: dronabinol

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS I nh ibitors and inducers of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 : May alter dronabinol systemic exposure; monitor for potential dronabinol-related adverse reactions or loss of efficacy. (7.3 ) H ighly protein-bound drugs : Potential for displacement of other drugs from plasma proteins; monitor for adverse reactions to concomitant highly protein-bound drugs and narrow therapeutic index drugs (e.g., warfarin, cyclosporine, amphotericin B) when initiating or increasing the dosage of dronabinol capsules. ( 7.4 ) 7.1 Additive CNS Effects Additive CNS effects (e.g., dizziness, confusion, sedation, somnolence) may occur when dronabinol capsules is taken concomitantly with drugs that have similar effects on the central nervous system such as CNS depressants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . 7.2 Additive Cardiac Effects Additive cardiac effects (e.g., hypotension, hypertension, syncope, tachycardia) may occur when dronabinol capsules is taken concomitantly with drugs that have similar effects on the cardiovascular system [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . 7.3 Effect of Other Drugs on Dronabinol Dronabinol is primarily metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 enzymes based on published in vitro studies. Inhibitors of these enzymes may increase, while inducers may decrease, the systemic exposure of dronabinol and/or its active metabolite resulting in an increase in dronabinol-related adverse reactions or loss of efficacy of dronabinol capsules. Monitor for potentially increased dronabinol-related adverse reactions when dronabinol capsules is co- administered with inhibitors of CYP2C9 (e.g., amiodarone, fluconazole) and inhibitors of CYP3A4 enzymes (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, erythromycin, grapefruit juice). 7.4 Highly Protein-Bound Drugs Dronabinol is highly bound to plasma proteins, and therefore, might displace and increase the free fraction of other concomitantly administered protein-bound drugs. Although this displacement has not been confirmed in vivo , monitor patients for increased adverse reactions to narrow therapeutic index drugs that are highly protein-bound (e.g., warfarin, cyclosporine, amphotericin B) when initiating treatment or increasing the dosage of dronabinol capsules.
