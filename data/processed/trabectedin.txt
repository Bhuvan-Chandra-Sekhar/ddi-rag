Drug: trabectedin

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CYP3A inhibitors: Avoid concomitant strong CYP3A inhibitors ( 7.1 ) CYP3A inducers: Avoid concomitant strong CYP3A inducers ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effect of Cytochrome CYP3A Inhibitors Coadministration of YONDELIS with ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increased systemic exposure of trabectedin by 66%. Avoid using strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., oral ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, indinavir, lopinavir, ritonavir, boceprevir, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, nefazodone, conivaptan) in patients taking YONDELIS. If a strong CYP3A inhibitor for short-term use (i.e., less than 14 days) must be used, administer the strong CYP3A inhibitor 1 week after the YONDELIS infusion, and discontinue it the day prior to the next YONDELIS infusion [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Effect of Cytochrome CYP3A Inducers Coadministration of YONDELIS with rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer, decreased systemic exposure of trabectedin by 31%. Avoid using strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenobarbital, St. John's wort) in patients taking YONDELIS [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .
Drug Interactions Effect of Strong CYP3A Inhibitors on Trabectedin Coadministration of multiple doses of ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily for 7.5 days) with a single dose of YONDELIS (0.58 mg/m 2 ) on day 1 increased trabectedin dose-normalized AUC by 66% and C max by 22% compared to a single YONDELIS dose (1.3 mg/m 2 ) given alone. Effect of Strong CYP3A Inducers on Trabectedin Coadministration of multiple doses of rifampin (600 mg daily for 6 days) with a single YONDELIS dose (1.3 mg/m 2 ) on day 6 decreased trabectedin AUC by 31% and C max by 21% compared to a single YONDELIS dose (1.3 mg/m 2 ) given alone. Effect of Trabectedin on CYP Enzymes In vitro , trabectedin has limited inhibition or induction potential of major CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4).
