Drug: darolutamide

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Combined P-gp and Strong or Moderate CYP3A Inducers : Avoid concomitant use. ( 7.1 ) Combined P-gp and Strong CYP3A Inhibitors : Monitor patients more frequently for NUBEQA adverse reactions. ( 7.1 ) BCRP Substrates : Avoid concomitant use with drugs that are BCRP substrates where possible. If used together, monitor patients more frequently for adverse reactions and consider dose reduction of the BCRP substrate drug. ( 7.2 ) OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 Substrates : Concomitant use of NUBEQA may increase the plasma concentrations of OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 substrates. If used together, monitor patients more frequently for adverse reactions and consider dose reduction of these drugs. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on NUBEQA Combined P-gp and Strong or Moderate CYP3A4 Inducer Concomitant use of NUBEQA with a combined P-gp and strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducer decreases darolutamide exposure which may decrease NUBEQA activity [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Avoid concomitant use of NUBEQA with combined P-gp and strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers. Combined P-gp and Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant use of NUBEQA with a combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitor increases darolutamide exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] which may increase the risk of NUBEQA adverse reactions . Monitor patients more frequently for NUBEQA adverse reactions and modify NUBEQA dosage as needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 7.2 Effects of NUBEQA on Other Drugs Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) and Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptides (OATP) 1B1 and 1B3 Substrates NUBEQA is an inhibitor of BCRP transporter. Concomitant use of NUBEQA increases the AUC and C max of BCRP substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], which may increase the risk of BCRP substrate-related toxicities. Avoid concomitant use with drugs that are BCRP substrates where possible. If used together, monitor patients more frequently for adverse reactions, and consider dose reduction of the BCRP substrate drug. NUBEQA is an inhibitor of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 transporters. Concomitant use of NUBEQA may increase the plasma concentrations of OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 substrates. Monitor patients more frequently for adverse reactions of these drugs and consider dose reduction while patients are taking NUBEQA [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , Review the prescribing information of the BCRP, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substrates when used concomitantly with NUBEQA.
