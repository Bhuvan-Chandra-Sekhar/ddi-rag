Drug: imlunestrant

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A Inhibitors: Avoid concomitant use with INLURIYO. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, decrease the INLURIYO dosage. ( 2.5 , 7.1 ) Strong CYP3A Inducers: Avoid concomitant use with INLURIYO. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, increase the INLURIYO dosage ( 2.5 , 7.1 ). 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on INLURIYO Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Avoid concomitant use of INLURIYO with strong CYP3A inhibitors. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, reduce the dosage of INLURIYO [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Imlunestrant is a CYP3A substrate. Concomitant use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor increases imlunestrant exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may increase the risk of INLURIYO-associated adverse reactions. Strong CYP3A Inducers Avoid concomitant use of INLURIYO with strong CYP3A inducers. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, increase the dosage of INLURIYO [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Imlunestrant is a CYP3A substrate. Concomitant use of a strong CYP3A inducer decreases imlunestrant exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may reduce effectiveness of INLURIYO. 7.2 Effects of INLURIYO on Other Drugs P-gp or BCRP Substrates Avoid concomitant use unless otherwise recommended in the Prescribing Information for P-gp or BCRP substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions. Imlunestrant inhibits both P-gp and BCRP. Imlunestrant increases exposure of P-gp and BCRP substrates, which may increase the risk of adverse reactions related to these substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )].
