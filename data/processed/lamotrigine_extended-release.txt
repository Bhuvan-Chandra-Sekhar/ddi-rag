=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Significant drug interactions with lamotrigine are summarized in this section. Additional details of these drug interaction studies, which were conducted using immediate-release lamotrigine, are provided in the Clinical Pharmacology section [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Uridine 5´-diphospho-glucuronyl transferases (UGT) have been identified as the enzymes responsible for metabolism of lamotrigine. Drugs that induce or inhibit glucuronidation may, therefore, affect the apparent clearance of lamotrigine. Strong or moderate inducers of the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme, which are also known to induce UGT, may also enhance the metabolism of lamotrigine. Those drugs that have been demonstrated to have a clinically significant impact on lamotrigine metabolism are outlined in Table 13. Specific dosing guidance for these drugs is provided in the Dosage and Administration section [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Table 5. Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions ↓ = Decreased (induces lamotrigine glucuronidation). ↑ = Increased (inhibits lamotrigine glucuronidation). ? = Conflicting data. Concomitant Drug Effect on Concentration of Lamotrigine or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment Estrogen-containing oral contraceptive preparations containing 30 mcg ethinylestradiol and 150 mcg levonorgestrel ↓ lamotrigine Decreased lamotrigine concentrations approximately 50%. ↓ levonorgestrel Decrease in levonorgestrel component by 19%. Carbamazepine and carbamazepine epoxide ↓ lamotrigine Addition of carbamazepine decreases lamotrigine concentration approximately 40%. ? carbamazepine epoxide May increase carbamazepine epoxide levels. Lopinavir/ritonavir ↓ lamotrigine Decreased lamotrigine concentration approximately 50%. Atazanavir/ritonavir ↓ lamotrigine Decreased lamotrigine AUC approximately 32%. Phenobarbital/primidone ↓ lamotrigine Decreased lamotrigine concentration approximately 40%. Phenytoin ↓ lamotrigine Decreased lamotrigine concentration approximately 40%. Rifampin ↓ lamotrigine Decreased lamotrigine AUC approximately 40%. Valproate ↑ lamotrigine Increased lamotrigine concentrations slightly more than 2-fold. ? valproate There are conflicting study results regarding effect of lamotrigine on valproate concentrations: 1) a mean 25% decrease in valproate concentrations in healthy volunteers, 2) no change in valproate concentrations in controlled clinical trials in patients with epilepsy. Effect of Lamotrigine Extended-Release Tablets on Organic Cationic Transporter 2 Substrates Lamotrigine is an inhibitor of renal tubular secretion via organic cationic transporter 2 (OCT2) proteins [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . This may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs that are substantially excreted via this route. Coadministration of Lamotrigine Extended-Release Tablets with OCT2 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., dofetilide) is not recommended. Valproate increases lamotrigine concentrations more than 2-fold. ( 7 , 12.3 ) Carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, and rifampin decrease lamotrigine concentrations by approximately 40%. ( 7 , 12.3 ) Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives decrease lamotrigine concentrations by approximately 50%. ( 7 , 12.3 ) Protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/lopinavir decrease lamotrigine exposure by approximately 50% and 32%, respectively. ( 7 , 12.3 ) Coadministration with organic cationic transporter 2 substrates with narrow therapeutic index is not recommended ( 7 , 12.3 )
