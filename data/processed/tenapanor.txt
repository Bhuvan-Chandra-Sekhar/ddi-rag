Drug: tenapanor

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS OATP2B1 Substrates: Potential for reduced exposure of the concomitant drug (e.g., enalapril). Monitor for signs related to loss of efficacy and adjust the dosage of the concomitantly administered drug as needed ( 7.1 ). Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate (SPS): Separate administration by at least three hours ( 7.2 ). 7.1 OATP2B1 Substrates Tenapanor is an inhibitor of intestinal uptake transporter, OATP2B1 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Drugs which are substrates of OATP2B1 may have reduced exposures when concomitantly taken with XPHOZAH. Monitor for signs related to loss of efficacy and adjust the dose of concomitantly administered drug as needed. Enalapril is a substrate of OATP2B1. When enalapril was coadministered with XPHOZAH (30 mg twice daily for five days), the peak exposure (C max ) of enalapril and its active metabolite, enalaprilat, decreased by approximately 70% and total systemic exposures (AUC) decreased by 50 to 65% compared to when enalapril was administered alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . However, the decrease in enalaprilat's exposure with XPHOZAH may be offset by the inherently higher exposures observed in patients with CKD on dialysis due to its reduced renal clearance. Therefore, a lower starting dose of enalapril, which is otherwise recommended in patients with CKD on dialysis is not required when enalapril is coadministered with XPHOZAH. 7.2 Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Separate administration of XPHOZAH and sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS) by at least 3 hours. SPS binds to many commonly prescribed oral medicines.
