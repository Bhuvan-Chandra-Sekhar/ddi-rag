Drug: dacomitinib

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs): Avoid use with VIZIMPRO; use locally-acting antacids or H2-receptor antagonist; administer VIZIMPRO at least 6 hours before or 10 hours after H2-receptor antagonist. ( 2.4 , 7.1 ) • CYP2D6 Substrates: Avoid concomitant use with VIZIMPRO where minimal increases in concentration of the CYP2D6 substrate may lead to serious or life-threatening toxicities. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on VIZIMPRO Concomitant use with a PPI decreases dacomitinib concentrations, which may reduce VIZIMPRO efficacy. Avoid the concomitant use of PPIs with VIZIMPRO. As an alternative to PPIs, use locally-acting antacids or an H2-receptor antagonist. Administer VIZIMPRO at least 6 hours before or 10 hours after taking an H2-receptor antagonist [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Effect of VIZIMPRO on CYP2D6 Substrates Concomitant use of VIZIMPRO increases the concentration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] which may increase the risk of toxicities of these drugs. Avoid concomitant use of VIZIMPRO with CYP2D6 substrates where minimal increases in concentration of the CYP2D6 substrate may lead to serious or life-threatening toxicities.
