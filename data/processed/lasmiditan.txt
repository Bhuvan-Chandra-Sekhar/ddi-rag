=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS REYVOW may further lower heart rate when administered with heart rate lowering drugs. ( 7.3 ) 7.1 CNS Depressants Concomitant administration of REYVOW and alcohol or other CNS depressant drugs has not been evaluated in clinical studies. Because of the potential of REYVOW to cause sedation, as well as other cognitive and/or neuropsychiatric adverse reactions, REYVOW should be used with caution if used in combination with alcohol or other CNS depressants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 7.2 Serotonergic Drugs Concomitant administration of REYVOW and drugs (e.g., SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, MAO inhibitors, trazodone, etc.), over-the counter medications (e.g., dextromethorphan), or herbal supplements (e.g., St. John's Wort) that increase serotonin may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Use REYVOW with caution in patients taking medications that increase serotonin. 7.3 Heart Rate Lowering Drugs REYVOW has been associated with a lowering of heart rate [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . In a drug interaction study, addition of a single 200 mg dose of REYVOW to propranolol decreased heart rate by an additional 5 beats per minute compared to propranolol alone, for a mean maximum of 19 beats per minute. Use REYVOW with caution in patients taking concomitant medications that lower heart rate if this magnitude of heart rate decrease may pose a concern. 7.4 P-glycoprotein (P-gp) Transporter Substrates Coadministration of REYVOW with P-gp substrates where a small change in substrate plasma concentration may lead to serious toxicities (e.g., digoxin) is not recommended [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] .
