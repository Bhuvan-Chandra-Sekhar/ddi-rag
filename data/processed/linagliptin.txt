Drug: linagliptin

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong P-glycoprotein/CYP3A4 inducer: The efficacy of TRADJENTA may be reduced when administered in combination (e.g., with rifampin). Use of alternative treatments is strongly recommended. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Inducers of P-glycoprotein or CYP3A4 Enzymes Rifampin decreased linagliptin exposure, suggesting that the efficacy of TRADJENTA may be reduced when administered in combination with a strong P-gp or CYP3A4 inducer. Therefore, use of alternative treatments is strongly recommended when linagliptin is to be administered with a strong P-gp or CYP3A4 inducer [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Insulin Secretagogues or Insulin Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycemia. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when linagliptin is used in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin. Coadministration of TRADJENTA with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may require lower dosages of the insulin secretagogue or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .
