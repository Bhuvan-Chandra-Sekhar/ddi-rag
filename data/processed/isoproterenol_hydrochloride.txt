7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 1. Clinically Relevant Interactions with Isoproterenol Epinephrine Clinical Impact Both drugs are direct cardiac stimulants, and their combined effects may induce serious arrhythmias upon simultaneous administration. Intervention Isoproterenol hydrochloride injection and epinephrine should not be administered simultaneously. Drugs that may potentiate clinical response of Isoproterenol Clinical Impact The effects of isoproterenol may be potentiated by tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, levothyroxine sodium, and certain antihistamines, notably chlorpheniramine, tripelennamine, and diphenhydramine. Intervention Monitor hemodynamic parameters in patients who concurrently are taking tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, levothyroxine sodium and certain antihistamines. Adjust doses appropriately. Drugs that may reduce clinical response of Isoproterenol Clinical Impact The cardiostimulating and bronchodilating effects of isoproterenol are antagonized by beta-adrenergic blocking drugs, such as propranolol. Intervention Monitor for hemodynamic response and relief of bronchospasm and adjust dose appropriately. Do not administer Isoproterenol hydrochloride injection and epinephrine simultaneously due to combined effects may induce serious arrhythmias ( 7) ) Concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, levothyroxine sodium and certain antihistamines; hemodynamic parameters may potentiate a clinical response of isoproterenol ( 7 ) Beta-adrenergic blocking drugs may reduce cardiostimulating and bronchodilating effects of isoproterenol ( 7 ) See 17 for PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION.
