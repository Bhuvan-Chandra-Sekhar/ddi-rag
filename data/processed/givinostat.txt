=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Closely monitor when DUVYZAT is used in combination with an oral CYP3A4 sensitive substrate or a sensitive substrate of the OCT2 transporter, for which a small change in substrate plasma concentration may lead to serious toxicities. ( 7.1 ) Avoid concomitant use with other drugs that prolong the QTc interval; monitor ECG if concomitant use cannot be avoided. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effect of DUVYZAT on Other Drugs CYP3A4 Sensitive Substrates Givinostat is a weak intestinal CYP3A4 inhibitor [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Closely monitor when DUVYZAT is used in combination with orally administered CYP3A4 sensitive substrates for which a small change in substrate plasma concentration may lead to serious toxicities. OCT2 Sensitive Substrates Givinostat is a weak inhibitor of the renal uptake transporter OCT2 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Closely monitor when DUVYZAT is used in combination with drugs known as a sensitive substrate of the OCT2 transporter for which a small change in substrate plasma concentration may lead to serious toxicities. 7.2 Effect of Other Drugs on DUVYZAT Drugs that Prolong the QTc Interval Avoid concomitant use of DUVYZAT with other product(s) with a known potential to prolong the QTc interval. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, obtain ECGs when initiating, during concomitant use, and as clinically indicated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Withhold DUVYZAT if the QTc interval is > 500 ms or the change from baseline is > 60 ms [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . DUVYZAT causes QTc interval prolongation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Concomitant use of DUVYZAT with other products that prolong the QTc interval may result in a greater increase in the QTc interval and adverse reactions associated with QTc interval prolongation, including Torsade de pointes, other serious arrythmias, and sudden death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] .
