Drug: doxycycline_hyclate

=== Drug Interactions ===
Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracyclines in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by bismuth subsalicylate. Barbiturates, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and rifampin shorten the half-life of doxycycline, thereby lowering doxycycline concentration in the body. Concurrent use of tetracycline may render oral contraceptives less effective.
