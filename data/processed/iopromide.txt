7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Drug-Drug Interactions Metformin In patients with renal impairment, biguanides can cause lactic acidosis. Iodinated contrast agents appear to increase the risk of metformin-induced lactic acidosis, possibly as a result of worsening renal function. Stop metformin at the time of, or prior to, ULTRAVIST administration in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast agents. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure and reinstitute only after renal function is stable. Radioactive Iodine ULTRAVIST may interfere with thyroid uptake of radioactive iodine (I-131 and I-123) and decrease therapeutic and diagnostic efficacy. Avoid thyroid therapy or testing for up to 6 weeks post ULTRAVIST. 7.2 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Protein-Bound Iodine Test Iodinated contrast agents, including ULTRAVIST, will temporarily increase protein-bound iodine in blood. Do not perform protein-bound iodine test for at least 16 days following administration of ULTRAVIST. However, thyroid function tests which do not depend on iodine estimations, for example, T 3 resin uptake and total or free thyroxine (T 4 ) assays are not affected.
