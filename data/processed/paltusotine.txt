Drug: paltusotine

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A4 Inducers: may decrease paltusotine exposure. May require PALSONIFY dosage increase ( 2.3 , 7.1 ). Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers: may decrease paltusotine exposure. May require PALSONIFY dosage increase ( 2.3 , 7.1 ). Proton Pump Inhibitors: may decrease paltusotine exposure. May require PALSONIFY dosage increase ( 2.3 , 7.1 ) Cyclosporine: may decrease cyclosporine exposure. May require cyclosporine dosage adjustment ( 7.2 ). 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on PALSONIFY Table 3. Clinically Significant Interactions Affecting PALSONIFY Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Intervention Concomitant use of PALSONIFY with strong CYP3A4 inducers may require an increased dosage of PALSONIFY, not to exceed three-fold the dose prior to concomitant use or 120 mg daily, whichever is less. Clinical Impact Concomitant use of PALSONIFY with strong CYP3A4 inducers reduced paltusotine exposure and may affect therapeutic response [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers Intervention Concomitant use of PALSONIFY with moderate CYP3A4 inducers may require an increased dosage of PALSONIFY, not to exceed two-fold the dose prior to concomitant use or 120 mg daily, whichever is less. Clinical Impact Concomitant use of PALSONIFY with moderate CYP3A4 inducers resulted in a decrease in paltusotine exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Proton Pump Inhibitors Intervention Concomitant use of PALSONIFY with PPIs may require an increased dosage of PALSONIFY. Patients who are already on PALSONIFY 60 mg should avoid concomitant use with proton pump inhibitors. Clinical Impact Concomitant use of PALSONIFY with proton pump inhibitors demonstrated a dose-dependent decrease in paltusotine exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.2 Effect of PALSONIFY on Other Drugs Table 4. Clinically Significant Interactions Affecting Other Drugs Cyclosporine Intervention Adjustment of cyclosporine dose to maintain therapeutic levels may be necessary. Follow recommended therapeutic drug monitoring for cyclosporine. Clinical Impact Concomitant use of PALSONIFY with cyclosporine resulted in a decrease in cyclosporine bioavailability [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )].
