Drug: elranatamab-bcmm

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS For certain CYP substrates, minimal changes in the concentration may lead to serious adverse reactions. Monitor for toxicity or drug concentrations of such CYP substrates when co-administered with ELREXFIO. ELREXFIO causes release of cytokines [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] that may suppress activity of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, resulting in increased exposure of CYP substrates. Increased exposure of CYP substrates is more likely to occur after the first dose of ELREXFIO Day 1 and up to 14 days after the 32 mg dose on Day 4 and during and after CRS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .
