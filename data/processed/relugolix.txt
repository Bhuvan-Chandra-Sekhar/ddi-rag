Drug: relugolix

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS P-gp Inhibitors: Avoid co-administration. If unavoidable, take ORGOVYX first, separate dosing by at least 6 hours, and monitor patients more frequently for adverse reactions ( 2.2 , 7.1 ). Combined P-gp and Strong CYP3A Inducers: Avoid co-administration. If unavoidable, increase the ORGOVYX dose to 240 mg once daily ( 2.3 , 7.1 ). 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on ORGOVYX P-gp Inhibitors Relugolix is a P-gp substrate. Co-administration of ORGOVYX with an oral P-gp inhibitor increases relugolix exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )], which may increase the risk of adverse reactions associated with ORGOVYX. Avoid co-administration of ORGOVYX with oral P-gp inhibitors. If co-administration with an oral P-gp inhibitor cannot be avoided, take ORGOVYX first and separate dosing by at least 6 hours. Monitor patients for increased adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Treatment with ORGOVYX may be interrupted for up to two weeks if a short course of treatment with a P-gp inhibitor is required. Resume ORGOVYX after the P-gp inhibitor is discontinued. If treatment with ORGOVYX is interrupted for greater than 7 days, restart ORGOVYX with a loading dose of 360 mg on the first day and continue with a dose of 120 mg once daily. Combined P-gp and Strong CYP3A Inducers Relugolix is a P-gp and CYP3A substrate. Co-administration of ORGOVYX with a combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inducer decreases relugolix exposure, which may reduce the effects of ORGOVYX [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Avoid co-administration of ORGOVYX with combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inducers. If co-administration cannot be avoided, increase the ORGOVYX dose. After discontinuation of the combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inducer, resume ORGOVYX once daily at the same dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] .
