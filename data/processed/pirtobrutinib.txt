Drug: pirtobrutinib

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A Inhibitors: Avoid concomitant use. If concomitant use is unavoidable, reduce the JAYPIRCA dose. ( 2.4 , 7.1 ) Strong or Moderate CYP3A Inducers: Avoid concomitant use. If concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inducers is unavoidable, increase the JAYPIRCA dose. ( 2.5 , 7.1 ) Sensitive CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP3A, P-gp, or BCRP Substrates: For substrates where minimal concentration changes may increase the risk of adverse reactions, follow recommendations for co-administration with CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP3A, P-gp, or BCRP inhibitors provided in their approved product labeling. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on JAYPIRCA Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Pirtobrutinib is a CYP3A substrate. Concomitant use of JAYPIRCA with a strong CYP3A inhibitor increased pirtobrutinib systemic exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may increase the risk of JAYPIRCA adverse reactions. Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors during treatment with JAYPIRCA. If concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors is unavoidable, reduce the JAYPIRCA dosage [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Strong or Moderate CYP3A Inducers Concomitant use of JAYPIRCA with a strong or moderate CYP3A inducer decreased pirtobrutinib systemic exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may reduce JAYPIRCA efficacy. Avoid concomitant use of JAYPIRCA with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers. If concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inducers is unavoidable, increase the JAYPIRCA dosage [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . 7.2 Effect of JAYPIRCA on Other Drugs Sensitive CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP3A, P-gp, or BCRP Substrates JAYPIRCA is a P-gp inhibitor, a moderate CYP2C8 and BCRP inhibitor, and a weak CYP2C19 and CYP3A inhibitor. Concomitant use of JAYPIRCA with sensitive P-gp, CYP2C8, BCRP, CYP2C19, or CYP3A substrates increased their plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )], which may increase the risk of adverse reactions related to these substrates for drugs which are sensitive to minimal concentration changes. Follow recommendations for sensitive CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP3A, P-gp, or BCRP substrates provided in their approved product labeling.
