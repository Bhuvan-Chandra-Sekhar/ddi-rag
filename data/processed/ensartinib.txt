Drug: ensartinib

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Moderate or Strong CYP3A Inhibitors : Avoid concomitant use with ENSACOVE. ( 7.1 ) Moderate or Strong CYP3A Inducers : Avoid concomitant use with ENSACOVE. ( 7.1 ) P-gp Inhibitor : Avoid concomitant use with ENSACOVE. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on ENSACOVE Table 5 describes drug interactions where concomitant use of another drug affects ENSACOVE. Table 5: Effect of Other Drugs on ENSACOVE Strong or Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Prevention or Management Avoid concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors with ENSACOVE. Mechanism and Clinical Effect(s) This recommendation is based upon a mechanistic understanding of ensartinib pharmacokinetics and it being a CYP3A4 substrate in vitro [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Concomitant use with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors may increase ensartinib exposure; however, this has not been studied clinically. Strong or Moderate CYP3A Inducers Prevention or Management Avoid concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A inducers with ENSACOVE. Mechanism and Clinical Effect(s) This recommendation is based upon a mechanistic understanding of ensartinib pharmacokinetics and it being a CYP3A4 substrate in vitro [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Concomitant use with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers may decrease ensartinib exposure; however, this has not been studied clinically. P-gp Inhibitors Prevention or Management Avoid concomitant use of P-gp inhibitors with ENSACOVE. Mechanism and Clinical Effect(s) This recommendation is based upon a mechanistic understanding of ensartinib pharmacokinetics and it being a P-gp substrate in vitro [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Concomitant use with P-gp inhibitors may increase ensartinib exposure; however, this has not been studied clinically.
