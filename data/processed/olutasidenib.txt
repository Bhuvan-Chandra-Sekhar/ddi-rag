Drug: olutasidenib

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong or moderate CYP3A Inducers: Avoid concomitant use. ( 7.1 ) Sensitive CYP3A Substrates: Avoid concomitant use. Monitor if unavoidable. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on Olutasidenib Strong or Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers Avoid concomitant use of REZLIDHIA with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers. Olutasidenib is a CYP3A substrate. Concomitant use of REZLIDHIA with a strong CYP3A inducer decreases olutasidenib Cmax and AUC, which may reduce REZLIDHIA efficacy [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Concomitant use of REZLIDHIA with a moderate CYP3A inducer may also decrease olutasidenib Cmax and AUC, which may also reduce REZLIDHIA efficacy, based on observations from concomitant use with a strong CYP3A inducer. 7.2 Effect of Olutasidenib on Other Drugs Sensitive CYP3A Substrates Avoid concomitant use of REZLIDHIA with sensitive CYP3A substrates unless otherwise instructed in the substrates prescribing information. If concomitant use is unavoidable, monitor patients for loss of therapeutic effect of these drugs. Olutasidenib induces CYP3A. Concomitant use of REZLIDHIA may decrease plasma concentrations of sensitive CYP3A substrates, which may reduce the substrate’s efficacy [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] .
