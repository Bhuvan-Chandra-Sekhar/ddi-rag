7 DRUG INTERACTIONS P-gp inducers: Avoid coadministration with PRADAXA ( 5.5 ) P-gp inhibitors in adult patients with CrCl 30-50 mL/min: Reduce dosage or avoid ( 7 ) P-gp inhibitors in adult patients with CrCl < 30 mL/min: Not recommended ( 7 ) 7.1 Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation in Adult Patients The concomitant use of PRADAXA with P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampin) reduces exposure to dabigatran and should generally be avoided [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . P-gp inhibition and impaired renal function are the major independent factors that result in increased exposure to dabigatran [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Concomitant use of P-gp inhibitors in patients with renal impairment is expected to produce increased exposure of dabigatran compared to that seen with either factor alone. In patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30-50 mL/min), reduce the dosage of PRADAXA to 75 mg twice daily when administered concomitantly with the P-gp inhibitors dronedarone or systemic ketoconazole. The use of the P-gp inhibitors verapamil, amiodarone, quinidine, clarithromycin, and ticagrelor does not require a dosage adjustment of PRADAXA. These results should not be extrapolated to other P-gp inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The concomitant use of PRADAXA and P-gp inhibitors in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl 15-30 mL/min) should be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Treatment and Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of Deep Venous Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism in Adult Patients Avoid use of PRADAXA and P-gp inhibitors in patients with CrCl < 50 mL/min [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.3 Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism in Adult Patients Following Hip Replacement Surgery In patients with CrCl ≥ 50 mL/min who have concomitant administration of P-gp inhibitors such as dronedarone or systemic ketoconazole, it may be helpful to separate the timing of administration of PRADAXA and the P-gp inhibitor by several hours. The concomitant use of PRADAXA and P-gp inhibitors in patients with CrCl < 50 mL/min should be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2 , 12.3) ] . 7.4 Treatment and Reduction in Risk of Recurrence of VTE in Pediatric Patients The concomitant use of PRADAXA with P-gp inhibitors has not been studied in pediatric patients but may increase exposure to dabigatran [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] .
