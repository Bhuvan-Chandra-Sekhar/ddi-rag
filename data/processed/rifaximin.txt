Drug: rifaximin

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Warfarin: Monitor INR and prothrombin time; dose adjustment of warfarin may be needed to maintain target INR range. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 P-glycoprotein Inhibitors Concomitant administration of cyclosporine, an inhibitor of P-gp and OATPs significantly increased the systemic exposure of rifaximin. In patients with hepatic impairment, a potential additive effect of reduced metabolism and concomitant P-gp inhibitors may further increase the systemic exposure to rifaximin. Caution should be exercised when concomitant use of XIFAXAN and a P-gp inhibitor such as cyclosporine is needed [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.2 Warfarin Changes in INR have been reported postmarketing in patients receiving rifaximin and warfarin concomitantly. Monitor INR and prothrombin time. Dose adjustment of warfarin may be needed to maintain target INR range. See prescribing information for warfarin. 7.3 CYP3A4 Substrates An in vitro study has suggested that rifaximin induces CYP3A4 [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . However, in patients with normal liver function, XIFAXAN at the recommended dosing regimen is not expected to induce CYP3A4. It is unknown whether rifaximin can have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of concomitant CYP3A4 substrates in patients with reduced liver function who have elevated rifaximin concentrations.
