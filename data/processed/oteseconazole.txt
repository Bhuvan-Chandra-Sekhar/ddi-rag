Drug: oteseconazole

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS BCRP (Breast Cancer Resistance Protein) Substrates: Concomitant use of VIVJOA with BCRP substrates may increase the exposure of drugs that are BCRP substrates, which may increase the risk of adverse reactions associated with these drugs. Use the lowest possible starting dose of the BCRP substrate or consider reducing the dose of the substrate drugs and monitor for adverse reactions. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Effect of VIVJOA on Other Drugs BCRP (Breast Cancer Resistance Protein) Transporter Substrates Oteseconazole is a BCRP inhibitor. Concomitant use of VIVJOA with BCRP substrates (e.g., rosuvastatin) may increase the exposure of BCRP substrates (e.g., rosuvastatin), which may increase the risk of adverse reactions associated with these drugs. Use the lowest possible starting dose of the BCRP substrate or consider reducing the dose of the substrate drug and monitor for adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .
