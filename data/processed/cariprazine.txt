7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 15 displays clinically significant drug interactions with VRAYLAR. Table 15. Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with VRAYLAR Strong or Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of VRAYLAR with a strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor increases the exposures of cariprazine and its major active metabolite, didesmethylcariprazine (DDCAR), compared to use of VRAYLAR alone [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Intervention: If VRAYLAR is used with a strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, reduce VRAYLAR dosage [see D osage and A dministration ( 2.6 ) ] . CYP3A4 Inducers Clinical Impact: CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation and elimination of the active metabolites of cariprazine. The effect of CYP3A4 inducers on the exposure of VRAYLAR has not been evaluated, and the net effect is unclear [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Intervention: Concomitant use of VRAYLAR with a CYP3A4 inducer is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.6 ) ] . Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors: Reduce VRAYLAR dosage ( 2.6 , 7 ) CYP3A4 inducers: Concomitant use is not recommended ( 2.6 , 7 )
