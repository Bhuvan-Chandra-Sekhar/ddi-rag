7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 4 displays clinically important drug interactions with ZURZUVAE. Table 4 Clinically Important Drug Interactions with ZURZUVAE CNS Depressant Drugs and Alcohol Clinical Impact Due to additive pharmacological effects, the concomitant use of CNS depressant drugs, including alcohol, may increase impairment of psychomotor performance or CNS depressant effects. Management If use with another CNS depressant is unavoidable, consider dosage reduction. Caution should be used when ZURZUVAE is administered in combination with other CNS drugs or alcohol [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Clinical Impact Concomitant use of ZURZUVAE with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor increases the exposure of zuranolone [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may increase the risk of ZURZUVAE-associated adverse reactions. Management Reduce the ZURZUVAE dosage when used with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. CYP3A4 Inducers Clinical Impact Concomitant use of ZURZUVAE with a CYP3A4 inducer decreases the exposure of zuranolone [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may reduce the efficacy of ZURZUVAE. Management Avoid concomitant use of ZURZUVAE with CYP3A4 inducers [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. CNS Depressants: Concomitant use may increase impairment of psychomotor performance or CNS depressant effects. If use with another CNS depressant is unavoidable, consider dosage reduction. ( 7 ) Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Concomitant use may increase the risk of ZURZUVAE-associated adverse reactions. Reduce the ZURZUVAE dosage to 30 mg orally once daily in the evening for 14 days when used concomitantly with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. ( 2.2 , 7 ) CYP3A4 Inducers: Concomitant use may decrease the efficacy of ZURZUVAE. Avoid concomitant use. ( 2.2 , 7 )
