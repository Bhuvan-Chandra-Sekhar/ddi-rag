Drug: vincristine_sulfate

=== Drug Interactions ===
Drug Interactions The simultaneous oral or intravenous administration of phenytoin and antineoplastic chemotherapy combinations that included vincristine sulfate has been reported to reduce blood levels of the anticonvulsant and to increase seizure activity. Dosage adjustment should be based on serial blood level monitoring. The contribution of vincristine sulfate to this interaction is not certain. The interaction may result from reduced absorption of phenytoin and an increase in the rate of its metabolism and elimination. Vincristine sulfate is a substrate for cytochrome P450 3A isozymes (CYP3A). Concurrent administration of vincristine sulfate with itraconazole or fluconazole (known inhibitors of the CYP3A metabolic pathway) has been reported to cause an earlier onset and/or an increased severity of neuromuscular side effects (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). This interaction is presumed to be related to inhibition of the metabolism of vincristine. Therefore, the concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors with vincristine sulfate should be avoided. Patients should be frequently monitored for adverse reactions with concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., fluconazole) with vincristine sulfate. Concurrent use of strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., St. John's Wort) with vincristine sulfate should be avoided. Vincristine sulfate is also a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Therefore, the concomitant use of P-gp inhibitors or inducers should be avoided.
Drug Interactions Vincristine Sulfate Injection should not be diluted in solutions that raise or lower the pH outside the range of 3.5 to 5.5. It should not be mixed with anything other than 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP. Whenever solution and container permit, parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.
