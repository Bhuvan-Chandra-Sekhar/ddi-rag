Drug: venetoclax

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors or P-gp inhibitors: Adjust dosage of VENCLEXTA. ( 2.6 , 7.1 ) Strong or moderate CYP3A inducers: Avoid co-administration. ( 7.1 ) P-gp substrates: Take at least 6 hours before VENCLEXTA. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on VENCLEXTA Strong or Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors or P-gp Inhibitors Concomitant use with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor or a P-gp inhibitor increases venetoclax C max and AUC 0-INF [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may increase VENCLEXTA toxicities, including the risk of TLS [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Concomitant use with a strong CYP3A inhibitor at initiation and during the ramp-up phase in patients with CLL/SLL is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . In patients with CLL/SLL taking a steady daily dosage (after ramp-up phase), consider alternative medications or adjust VENCLEXTA dosage and monitor more frequently for adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 , 2.6 )] . In patients with AML, adjust VENCLEXTA dosage and monitor more frequently for adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 , 2.6 )] . Resume the VENCLEXTA dosage that was used prior to concomitant use with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor or a P-gp inhibitor 2 to 3 days after discontinuation of the inhibitor [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 , 2.6 )] . Avoid grapefruit products, Seville oranges, and starfruit during treatment with VENCLEXTA, as they contain inhibitors of CYP3A. Strong or Moderate CYP3A Inducers Concomitant use with a strong CYP3A inducer decreases venetoclax C max and AUC 0-INF [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may decrease VENCLEXTA efficacy. Avoid concomitant use of VENCLEXTA with strong CYP3A inducers or moderate CYP3A inducers. 7.2 Effect of VENCLEXTA on Other Drugs Warfarin Concomitant use of VENCLEXTA increases warfarin C max and AUC 0-INF [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may increase the risk of bleeding. Monitor international normalized ratio (INR) more frequently in patients using warfarin concomitantly with VENCLEXTA. P-gp Substrates Concomitant use of VENCLEXTA increases C max and AUC 0-INF of P-gp substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may increase toxicities of these substrates. Avoid concomitant use of VENCLEXTA with a P-gp substrate. If a concomitant use is unavoidable, separate dosing of the P-gp substrate at least 6 hours before VENCLEXTA.
