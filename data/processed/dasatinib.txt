Drug: dasatinib

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Dose reduction may be necessary. ( 2.3 , 7.1 ) Strong CYP3A4 Inducers: Dose increase may be necessary. ( 2.3 , 7.1 ) Antacids: Avoid simultaneous administration. ( 7.1 ) H 2 Antagonists and Proton Pump Inhibitors: Avoid coadministration. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on Dasatinib Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors The coadministration with strong CYP3A inhibitors may increase dasatinib concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Increased dasatinib concentrations may increase the risk of toxicity. Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. If concomitant administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided, consider a dasatinib dose reduction [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . Strong CYP3A4 Inducers The coadministration of dasatinib with strong CYP3A inducers may decrease dasatinib concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Decreased dasatinib concentrations may reduce efficacy. Consider alternative drugs with less enzyme induction potential. If concomitant administration of a strong CYP3A4 inducer cannot be avoided, consider a dasatinib dose increase. Gastric Acid Reducing Agents The coadministration of dasatinib with a gastric acid reducing agent may decrease the concentrations of dasatinib. Decreased dasatinib concentrations may reduce efficacy. Do not administer H 2 antagonists or proton pump inhibitors with dasatinib. Consider the use of antacids in place of H 2 antagonists or proton pump inhibitors. Administer the antacid at least 2 hours prior to or 2 hours after the dose of dasatinib. Avoid simultaneous administration of dasatinib with antacids.
