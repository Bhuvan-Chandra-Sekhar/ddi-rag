Drug: osimertinib

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A Inducers : Avoid concomitant use. If not possible, increase TAGRISSO to 160 mg daily in patients receiving a strong CYP3A4 inducer. ( 2.5 , 7.1 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on Osimertinib Strong CYP3A Inducers Co-administering TAGRISSO with a strong CYP3A4 inducer decreased the exposure of osimertinib compared to administering TAGRISSO alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Decreased osimertinib exposure may lead to reduced efficacy. Avoid co-administering TAGRISSO with strong CYP3A inducers. Increase the TAGRISSO dosage when co-administering with a strong CYP3A4 inducer if concurrent use is unavoidable [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . No dose adjustments are required when TAGRISSO is used with moderate and/or weak CYP3A inducers. 7.2 Effect of Osimertinib on Other Drugs Co-administering TAGRISSO with a breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP) or P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate increased the exposure of the substrate compared to administering it alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Increased BCRP or P-gp substrate exposure may increase the risk of exposure-related toxicity. Monitor for adverse reactions of the BCRP or P-gp substrate, unless otherwise instructed in its approved labeling, when co-administered with TAGRISSO. 7.3 Drugs That Prolong the QTc Interval The effect of co-administering medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval with TAGRISSO is unknown. When feasible, avoid concomitant administration of drugs known to prolong the QTc interval with known risk of Torsades de pointes. If not feasible to avoid concomitant administration of such drugs, conduct periodic ECG monitoring [see Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ].
