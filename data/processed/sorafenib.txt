7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A Inducers: Avoid strong CYP3A4 inducers. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on Sorafenib Strong CYP3A4 Inducers The concomitant use of sorafenib with rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer decreased the mean AUC of sorafenib, which may decrease the antitumor activity [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Avoid concomitant use of sorafenib with strong CYP3A4 inducers, when possible, because these drugs can decrease the systemic exposure to sorafenib. Neomycin The concomitant use of sorafenib with neomycin decreased the mean AUC of sorafenib, which may decrease the antitumor activity. Avoid concomitant use of sorafenib with neomycin. The effects of other antibiotics on the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib have not been studied [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.2 Concomitant Use of Warfarin The concomitant use of sorafenib and warfarin may increase the risk of bleeding or increased the INR. Monitor INR and for clinical bleeding episodes in patients taking warfarin while receiving sorafenib [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. 7.3 Drugs That Prolong the QT Interval Sorafenib tablets are associated with QTc interval prolongation. Avoid coadministration of sorafenib tablets with medicinal products with a known potential to prolong QT/QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] .
