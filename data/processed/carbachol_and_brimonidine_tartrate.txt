Drug: carbachol_and_brimonidine_tartrate

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Antihypertensives/cardiac glycosides may lower blood pressure. ( 7.1 ) Use with CNS depressants may result in an additive or potentiating effect. ( 7.2 ) Tricyclic antidepressants may potentially blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine. ( 7.3 ) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors may result in increased hypotension. ( 7.4 ) 7.1 Antihypertensives/Cardiac Glycosides Because brimonidine tartrate, a component of YUVEZZI, may reduce blood pressure, caution in using drugs such as antihypertensives and/or cardiac glycosides with YUVEZZI is advised. 7.2 CNS Depressants Although specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with YUVEZZI, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with central nervous system (CNS) depressants (alcohol, opiates, barbiturates, sedatives, or anesthetics) should be considered. 7.3 Tricyclic Antidepressants Tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine. It is not known whether the concurrent use of these agents with YUVEZZI in humans can lead to resulting interference with pupil constriction effects. Caution is advised in patients taking tricyclic antidepressants, which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines. 7.4 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may theoretically interfere with the metabolism of brimonidine tartrate and potentially result in an increased systemic side effect such as hypotension. Caution is advised in patients taking MAO inhibitors which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines.
