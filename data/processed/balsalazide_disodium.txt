Drug: balsalazide_disodium

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Nephrotoxic Agents including NSAIDs : Increased risk of nephrotoxicity; monitor for changes in renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. ( 7.1 ) • Azathioprine or 6-Mercaptopurine : Increased risk of blood disorders; monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Nephrotoxic Agents, Including Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs The concurrent use of mesalamine with known nephrotoxic agents, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), may increase the risk of renal reactions. Monitor patients taking nephrotoxic drugs for changes in renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 7.2 Azathioprine or 6-Mercaptopurine The concurrent use of mesalamine with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and/or any other drugs known to cause myelotoxicity may increase the risk for blood disorders, bone marrow failure, and associated complications. If concomitant use of balsalazide disodium capsules and azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine cannot be avoided, monitor blood tests, including complete blood cell counts and platelet counts. 7.3 Interference With Urinary Normetanephrine Measurements Use of balsalazide disodium capsules, which is converted to mesalamine, may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] . Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine.
