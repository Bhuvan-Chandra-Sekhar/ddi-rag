=== Drug Interactions ===
Drug Interactions Ceftriaxone Precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium can occur when ceftriaxone is mixed with calcium-containing solutions, such as Lactated Ringer’s Injection USP, in the same intravenous administration line. Do not administer ceftriaxone simultaneously with Lactated Ringer’s Injection USP via a Y-site. However, in patients other than neonates, ceftriaxone and Lactated Ringer’s Injection USP may be administered sequentially if the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid [see Warnings, Dosage and Administration ]. Deaths have occurred in neonates (28 days of age or younger) who received concomitant intravenous calcium-containing solutions with ceftriaxone resulting from calcium-ceftriaxone precipitates in the lungs and kidneys, even when separate infusion lines were used [see Contraindications, Warnings, Pediatric Use, Dosage and Administration ]. Some additives may be incompatible. Consult with pharmacist. When introducing additives, use aseptic techniques. Mix thoroughly. Do not store.
