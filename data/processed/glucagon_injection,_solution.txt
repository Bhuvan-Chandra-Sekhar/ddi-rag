=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 4: Clinically Significant Drug Interaction with GVOKE and GVOKE VialDx Beta-Blockers Clincial Impact: Patients taking beta-blockers may have a transient increase in pulse and blood pressure when given GVOKE or GVOKE VialDx. Intervention The increase in blood pressure and heart rate may require therapy in patients with coronary artery disease. Insulin Clincial Impact: Insulin acts antagonistically to glucagon. Intervention Monitor blood glucose when GVOKE VialDx is used as a diagnostic aid in patients receiving insulin. Indomethacin Clincial Impact: In patients taking indomethacin, GVOKE may lose its ability to raise blood glucose or may even produce hypoglycemia. Intervention Monitor blood glucose levels during glucagon treatment of patients taking indomethacin. Anticholinergic Drugs Clincial Impact: The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs and GVOKE VialDx increases the risk of gastrointestinal adverse reactions due to additive effects on inhibition of gastrointestinal motility. Intervention Concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs with GVOKE VialDx is not recommended. Warfarin Clincial Impact: GVOKE and GVOKE Vial Dx may increase the anticoagulant effect of warfarin. Intervention Monitor patients for unusual bruising or bleeding, as adjustments in warfarin dosage may be required. Beta-blockers: GVOKE- or GVOKE VialDx-treated patients taking concomitant beta-blockers may have a transient increase in pulse and blood pressure. ( 7 ) Indomethacin: In patients taking concomitant indomethacin, GVOKE may lose its ability to raise glucose or may produce hypoglycemia. ( 7 ) Anticholinergic drugs: Concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs with GVOKE VialDx for use as a diagnostic aid is not recommended. ( 7 ) Warfarin: GVOKE and GVOKE VialDx may increase the anticoagulant effect of warfarin. ( 7 ) Insulin: Monitor blood glucose when GVOKE VialDx is used as a diagnostic aid in patients receiving insulin. ( 7 ) See 17 for PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION and FDA ‑ approved patient labeling for GVOKE.
