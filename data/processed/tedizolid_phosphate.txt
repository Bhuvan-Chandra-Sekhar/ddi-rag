=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Orally administered SIVEXTRO inhibits Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) in the intestine, which can increase the plasma concentrations of orally administered BCRP substrates, and the potential for adverse reactions. If possible, an interruption in the treatment of the co-administered BCRP substrate medicinal product should be considered during treatment with SIVEXTRO, especially for BCRP substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., methotrexate or topotecan). If coadministration cannot be avoided, monitor for adverse reactions related to the concomitantly administered BCRP substrates, including rosuvastatin. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .] SIVEXTRO (when administered orally) can increase the plasma concentrations of orally administered Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) substrates. Monitor for adverse reactions related to the concomitant BCRP substrates if coadministration cannot be avoided. ( 7 , 12.3 )
