=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 3 includes a list of drugs with clinically important drug interactions when administered concomitantly with NEXLETOL and instructions for preventing or managing them. Table 3. Clinically Important Drug Interactions with NEXLETOL Simvastatin Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of NEXLETOL with simvastatin causes an increase in simvastatin concentration and may increase the risk of simvastatin-related myopathy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Intervention : Avoid concomitant use of NEXLETOL with simvastatin greater than 20 mg. Pravastatin Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of NEXLETOL with pravastatin causes an increase in pravastatin concentration and may increase the risk of pravastatin-related myopathy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Intervention: Avoid concomitant use of NEXLETOL with pravastatin greater than 40 mg. Fibrates Clinical Impact: Concomitant administration of fibrates with NEXLETOL resulted in increased triglycerides and decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in some patients in clinical studies and post-marketing reports. Reversibility of both increased triglycerides and decreased HDL-C levels was observed when either NEXLETOL or fibrate therapy was discontinued. Intervention: Monitor triglycerides and HDL-C four weeks after initial concomitant use of NEXLETOL and a fibrate and periodically thereafter. If increased triglycerides or decreased HDL-C levels are detected, discontinue NEXLETOL or fibrate therapy based on clinical judgment. Monitor triglycerides and HDL-C levels until levels return to baseline. Simvastatin: Avoid concomitant use of NEXLETOL with simvastatin greater than 20 mg. ( 7 ) Pravastatin: Avoid concomitant use of NEXLETOL with pravastatin greater than 40 mg. ( 7 ) Fibrates: Concomitant use of NEXLETOL with fibrates may increase triglycerides and decrease high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. ( 7 )
