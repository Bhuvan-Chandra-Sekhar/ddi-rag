Drug: brivaracetam

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Rifampin Because of decreased concentrations, increasing brivaracetam dosage in patients on concomitant rifampin is recommended. ( 2.6 , 7.1 ) Carbamazepine Because of increased exposure to carbamazepine metabolite, if tolerability issues arise, consider reducing carbamazepine dosage in patients on concomitant brivaracetam. ( 7.2 ) Phenytoin Because phenytoin concentrations can increase, phenytoin levels should be monitored in patients on concomitant brivaracetam. ( 7.3 ) Levetiracetam Brivaracetam had no added therapeutic benefit when co-administered with levetiracetam. ( 7.4 ) 7.1 Rifampin Co-administration with rifampin decreases brivaracetam plasma concentrations likely because of CYP2C19 induction [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Prescribers should increase the brivaracetam dose by up to 100% (i.e., double the dosage) in patients while receiving concomitant treatment with rifampin [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . 7.2 Carbamazepine Co-administration with carbamazepine may increase exposure to carbamazepine-epoxide, the active metabolite of carbamazepine. Though available data did not reveal any safety concerns, if tolerability issues arise when co-administered, carbamazepine dose reduction should be considered [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.3 Phenytoin Because brivaracetam can increase plasma concentrations of phenytoin, phenytoin levels should be monitored in patients when concomitant brivaracetam is added to or discontinued from ongoing phenytoin therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.4 Levetiracetam Brivaracetam provided no added therapeutic benefit to levetiracetam when the two drugs were co-administered [see Clinical Studies (14) ].
