Drug: osilodrostat

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CYP3A4 Inhibitor: Reduce the dose of ISTURISA by half with concomitant use of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ( 7.1 ) CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 Inducers: An increase of ISTURISA dosage may be needed if ISTURISA is used concomitantly with strong CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 inducers. A reduction in ISTURISA dosage may be needed if strong CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 inducers are discontinued while using ISTURISA ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on ISTURISA The effect of other drugs on ISTURISA can be found in Table 3. Table 3: Effect of Other Drugs on ISTURISA CYP3A4 Inhibitors Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of ISTURISA with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin) may cause an increase in osilodrostat concentration and may increase the risk of ISTURISA-related adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Intervention : Reduce the dose of ISTURISA by half with concomitant use of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 Inducers Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of ISTURISA with strong CYP3A4 and/or CYP2B6 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, rifampin, phenobarbital) may cause a decrease in osilodrostat concentration and may reduce the efficacy of ISTURISA [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Discontinuation of strong CYP3A4 and/or CYP2B6 inducers while using ISTURISA may cause an increase in osilodrostat concentration and may increase the risk of ISTURISA-related adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Intervention: During concomitant use of ISTURISA with strong CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 inducers, monitor cortisol concentration and patient's signs and symptoms. An increase in ISTURISA dosage may be needed. Upon discontinuation of strong CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 inducers during ISTURISA treatment, monitor cortisol concentration and patient's signs and symptoms. A reduction in ISTURISA dosage may be needed. 7.2 Effect of ISTURISA on Other Drugs ISTURISA should be used with caution when coadministered with CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, such as theophylline, tizanidine, and S-mephenytoin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .
