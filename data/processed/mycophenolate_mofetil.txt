Drug: mycophenolate_mofetil

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • See FPI for drugs that may interfere with systemic exposure and reduce mycophenolate mofetil efficacy: antacids with magnesium or aluminum hydroxide, proton pump inhibitors, drugs that interfere with enterohepatic recirculation, telmisartan, calcium-free phosphate binders. ( 7.1 ) • Mycophenolate mofetil may reduce effectiveness of oral contraceptives. Use of additional barrier contraceptive methods is recommended. ( 7.2 ) • See FPI for other important drug interactions. ( 7 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on Mycophenolate Mofetil Table 7 Drug Interactions with Mycophenolate Mofetil that Affect Mycophenolic Acid (MPA) Exposure Antacids with Magnesium or Aluminum Hydroxide Clinical Impact Concomitant use with an antacid containing magnesium or aluminum hydroxide decreases MPA systemic exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may reduce mycophenolate mofetil efficacy. Prevention or Management Administer magnesium or aluminum hydroxide containing antacids at least 2h after mycophenolate mofetil administration. Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) Clinical Impact Concomitant use with PPIs decreases MPA systemic exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may reduce mycophenolate mofetil efficacy. Prevention or Management Monitor patients for alterations in efficacy when PPIs are co-administered with mycophenolate mofetil Examples Lansoprazole, pantoprazole Drugs that Interfere with Enterohepatic Recirculation Clinical Impact Concomitant use with drugs that directly interfere with enterohepatic recirculation, or indirectly interfere with enterohepatic recirculation by altering the gastrointestinal flora, can decrease MPA systemic exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may reduce mycophenolate mofetil efficacy. Prevention or Management Monitor patients for alterations in efficacy or mycophenolate mofetil related adverse reactions when these drugs are co-administered with mycophenolate mofetil Examples Cyclosporine A, trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole, bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine), rifampin as well as aminoglycoside, cephalosporin, fluoroquinolone and penicillin classes of antimicrobials Drugs Modulating Glucuronidation Clinical Impact Concomitant use with drugs inducing glucuronidation decreases MPA systemic exposure, potentially reducing mycophenolate mofetil efficacy, while use with drugs inhibiting glucuronidation increases MPA systemic exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may increase the risk of mycophenolate mofetil related adverse reactions. Prevention or Management Monitor patients for alterations in efficacy or mycophenolate mofetil related adverse reactions when these drugs are co-administered with mycophenolate mofetil Examples Telmisartan (induces glucuronidation); isavuconazole (inhibits glucuronidation). Calcium Free Phosphate Binders Clinical Impact Concomitant use with calcium free phosphate binders decrease MPA systemic exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may reduce mycophenolate mofetil efficacy. Prevention or Management Administer calcium free phosphate binders at least 2 hours after mycophenolate mofetil Examples Sevelamer 7.2 Effect of Mycophenolate Mofetil on Other Drugs Table 8 Drug Interactions with Mycophenolate Mofetil that Affect Other Drugs Drugs that Undergo Renal Tubular Secretion Clinical Impact When concomitantly used with mycophenolate mofetil, its metabolite MPAG, may compete with drugs eliminated by renal tubular secretion which may increase plasma concentrations and/or adverse reactions associated with these drugs. Prevention or Management Monitor for drug-related adverse reactions in patients with renal impairment. Examples Acyclovir, ganciclovir, probenecid, valacyclovir, valganciclovir Combination Oral Contraceptives Clinical Impact Concomitant use with mycophenolate mofetil decreased the systemic exposure to levonorgestrel, but did not affect the systemic exposure to ethinylestradiol [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may result in reduced combination oral contraceptive effectiveness. Prevention or Management Use additional barrier contraceptive methods.
