Drug: nitrofurantoin

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Antacids : Decreased absorption of nitrofurantoin. (7.1) Uricosuric drugs: Inhibit renal tubular secretion of nitrofurantoin. (7.2) 7.1 Antacids Antacids containing magnesium trisilicate, when administered concomitantly with nitrofurantoin, reduce both the rate and extent of absorption. The mechanism for this interaction probably is adsorption of nitrofurantoin onto the surface of magnesium trisilicate. If coadministration of nitrofurantoin oral suspension with antacids containing magnesium trisilicate cannot be avoided, monitor for lack of efficacy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Uricosuric Drugs Uricosuric drugs, such as probenecid and sulfinpyrazone, can inhibit renal tubular secretion of nitrofurantoin. The resulting increase in nitrofurantoin serum levels may increase toxicity, and the decreased urinary levels could lessen its efficacy as a urinary tract antibacterial. Therefore, monitor for nitrofurantoin adverse reactions when co-administering nitrofurantoin oral suspension with uricosuric drugs. 7.3 Drug Interference with Laboratory Tests The presence of nitrofurantoin can cause a false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine when using Benedict's or Fehling's copper reduction reaction to determine the amount of reducing substances like glucose in the urine. Use glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions to detect glucose in the urine.
