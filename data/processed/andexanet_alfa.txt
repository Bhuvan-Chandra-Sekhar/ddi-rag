=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Do not use unfractionated heparin following ANDEXXA administration due to unresponsiveness characterized by non-prolongation of activated clotting times ( 7.1 ). See full prescribing information for details on drug interactions. 7.1 Use with Unfractionated Heparin Unresponsiveness to unfractionated heparin has occurred following ANDEXXA administration, characterized by non-prolongation of activated clotting times and requirement for increased dosing of heparin. Do not use unfractionated heparin following ANDEXXA administration. 7.2 Interference with Anti-FXa Activity Test Current commercial clinical anti-FXa-activity assays are unsuitable for measuring FXa activity following administration of ANDEXXA. Due to the reversible binding of ANDEXXA to the FXa inhibitor, the high sample dilution currently used in commercial clinical assays promotes dissociation of the inhibitor from ANDEXXA, resulting in detection of erroneously elevated anti-FXa activity levels, thereby causing a underestimation of the reversal activity of ANDEXXA.
