Drug: testosterone_undecanoate

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS - Insulin: In patients with diabetes, concomitant use with KYZATREX® may decrease blood glucose and insulin requirements ( 7.1 ). Oral Anticoagulants: Concomitant use with KYZATREX® may cause changes in anticoagulant activity. Monitor International Normalized Ratio (INR) and prothrombin time (PT) frequently ( 7.2 ). Corticosteroids: Concomitant use with KYZATREX® may result in increased fluid retention. Use with caution, particularly in patients with cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease ( 7.3 ). Drugs that May Also Increase Blood Pressure: Concomitant use with KYZATREX® may lead to additional increases in blood pressure ( 7.4 ). 7.1 Insulin Changes in insulin sensitivity or glycemic control may occur in patients treated with androgens. In diabetic patients, the metabolic effects of androgens may decrease blood glucose and therefore necessitate a decrease in the dose of anti-diabetic medication. 7.2 Oral Vitamin K Antagonist Anticoagulants Changes in anticoagulant activity may be seen with androgens; therefore, more frequent monitoring of international normalized ratio (INR) and prothrombin time are recommended in patients taking warfarin, especially at the initiation and termination of androgen therapy. 7.3 Corticosteroids The concurrent use of testosterone with corticosteroids may result in increased fluid retention and requires careful monitoring particularly in patients with cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. 7.4 Medications that May Also Increase Blood Pressure Some prescription medications and nonprescription analgesic and cold medications contain drugs known to increase blood pressure. Concomitant administration of these medications with KYZATREX® may lead to additional increases in blood pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] .
