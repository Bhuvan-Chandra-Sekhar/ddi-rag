( 7 ) 7.1 Concomitant Medications Consider the possibility of thrombotic events when systemic antifibrinolytics such as tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid are used during treatment with FEIBA. No adequate and well-controlled studies of the combined or sequential use of FEIBA and recombinant factor VIIa antifibrinolytics, or emicizumab have been conducted. Use of antifibrinolytics within approximately 6 to 12 hours after the administration of FEIBA is not recommended. Clinical experience from an emicizumab clinical trial suggests that a potential drug interaction may exist with emicizumab when FEIBA was used as part of a treatment regimen for breakthrough bleeding 6 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .
