=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions with dopamine. Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Dopamine Halogenated Anesthetics Clinical Impact: Concomitant use may increase cardiac autonomic irritability and can sensitize the myocardium to the action of dopamine which may lead to ventricular arrhythmias and hypertension. Intervention: Monitor cardiac rhythm. Examples: desflurane, enflurane, isoflurane, and sevoflurane. MAO Inhibitors Clinical Impact: Because dopamine is metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO), inhibition of this enzyme prolongs and potentiates the effect of dopamine which may result in severe hypertension and cardiac arrhythmia. Intervention: Reduce the recommended starting dosage to no greater than one-tenth (1/10) of the recommended dose in patients who have been treated with MAO inhibitors within two to three weeks prior to the administration of Dopamine HCl in Dextrose Injection. Examples: isocarboxazid, phenelzine, tranylcypromine, rasagiline, selegiline, linezolid. Tricyclic Antidepressants Clinical Impact: Concomitant use may potentiate the cardiovascular effects of dopamine (e.g., hypertension). Intervention: Monitor blood pressure. Examples: amitriptyline, desipramine, doxepin, imipramine, nortriptyline. Vasopressors Clinical Impact: Concomitant use may result in severe hypertension. Intervention: Monitor blood pressure. Examples: norepinephrine, epinephrine, oxytocin. • Halogenated anesthetics : Can sensitize the myocardium to the effects of dopamine and can produce ventricular arrhythmias and hypertension. ( 7 ) • MAO inhibitors : Risk of severe hypertension. Reduce recommended Dopamine HCl in Dextrose Injection dosage. ( 7 ) • Tricyclic antidepressants : Risk of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure. ( 7 ) • Vasopressors : Risk of severe hypertension. Monitor blood pressure. ( 7 )
