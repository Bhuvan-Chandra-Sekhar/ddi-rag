=== Drug Interactions ===
Drug Interactions Alcohol Alcohol may increase the CNS depressant effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate and may cause drowsiness (see WARNINGS ). Avoid concomitant use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets with alcohol. Other Drugs that Cause CNS Depression The concurrent use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate with other drugs that cause CNS depression (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, muscle relaxants), may potentiate the effects of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate (see WARNINGS ). Either diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets or the other interacting drug should be chosen, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient. If CNS-acting drugs cannot be avoided, monitor patients for CNS adverse reactions. MAO Inhibitors Diphenoxylate may interact with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and precipitate a hypertensive crisis. Avoid use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in patients who take MAOIs and monitor for signs and symptoms of hypertensive crisis (headache, hyperthermia, hypertension).
