Drug: gabapentin

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concentrations increased by morphine; may need dose adjustment. ( 5.4 , 7.1 ) 7.1 Opioids Respiratory depression and sedation, sometimes resulting in death, have been reported following co-administration of gabapentin with opioids (e.g., morphine, hydrocodone, oxycodone, buprenorphine) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Hydrocodone Co-administration of gabapentin with hydrocodone decreases hydrocodone exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The potential for alteration in hydrocodone exposure and effect should be considered when gabapentin is started or discontinued in a patient taking hydrocodone. Morphine When gabapentin is administered with morphine, patients should be observed for signs of CNS depression, such as somnolence, sedation and respiratory depression [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Other Antiepileptic Drugs Gabapentin is not appreciably metabolized nor does it interfere with the metabolism of commonly co-administered antiepileptic drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 Maalox ® (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide) The mean bioavailability of gabapentin was reduced by about 20% with concomitant use of an antacid (Maalox ® ) containing magnesium and aluminum hydroxides. It is recommended that gabapentin be taken at least 2 hours following Maalox administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.4 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Because false positive readings were reported with the Ames N-Multistix SG ® dipstick test for urinary protein when gabapentin was added to other antiepileptic drugs, the more specific sulfosalicylic acid precipitation procedure is recommended to determine the presence of urine protein.
