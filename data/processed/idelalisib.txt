Drug: idelalisib

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A Inhibitors : Additional monitoring required if alternative therapy is not available. ( 7.1 ) Strong CYP3A Inducers : Avoid coadministration of strong CYP3A inducers. ( 7.1 ) CYP3A Substrates : Avoid coadministration of sensitive CYP3A substrates. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Zydelig Table 6 lists the potential effects of the coadministration of strong CYP3A modulators on Zydelig. Table 6 Drug Interactions with Zydelig that affect Idelalisib Concentrations Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Clinical Impact Coadministration with strong CYP3A inhibitors may increase idelalisib concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Increased idelalisib concentrations may increase the risk of exposure related adverse reactions. Prevention or Management Use other drugs that are not strong CYP3A inhibitors. If unable to use alternative drugs, monitor patients more frequently for Zydelig adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Strong CYP3A Inducers Clinical Impact Coadministration with strong CYP3A inducers may decrease idelalisib concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Decreased idelalisib concentrations may reduce efficacy. Prevention or Management Avoid coadministration of Zydelig with strong CYP3A4 inducers. 7.2 Effects of Zydelig on Other Drugs The coadministration of Zydelig with a CYP3A substrate may increase the concentrations of this CYP3A substrate. Avoid coadministration of Zydelig with sensitive CYP3A substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].
