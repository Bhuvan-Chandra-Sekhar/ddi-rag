7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 5: Clinically Relevant Interactions with FARXIGA Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues Clinical Impact The risk of hypoglycemia may be increased when FARXIGA is used concomitantly with insulin or insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Intervention Concomitant use may require lower doses of insulin or the insulin secretagogue to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. Lithium Clinical Impact Concomitant use of an SGLT2 inhibitor with lithium may decrease serum lithium concentrations. Intervention Monitor serum lithium concentration more frequently during FARXIGA initiation and dosage changes. Positive Urine Glucose Test Clinical Impact SGLT2 inhibitors increase urinary glucose excretion and will lead to positive urine glucose tests. Intervention Monitoring glycemic control with urine glucose tests is not recommended in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Use alternative methods to monitor glycemic control. Interference with 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) Assay Clinical Impact Measurements of 1,5-AG are unreliable in assessing glycemic control in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Intervention Monitoring glycemic control with 1,5-AG assay is not recommended. Use alternative methods to monitor glycemic control. See full prescribing information for information on drug interactions and interference of FARXIGA with laboratory tests. (7)
Drug Interactions In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions In in vitro studies, dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide neither inhibited CYP 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4, nor induced CYP 1A2, 2B6, or 3A4. Dapagliflozin is a weak substrate of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) active transporter, and dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide is a substrate for the OAT3 active transporter. Dapagliflozin or dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide did not meaningfully inhibit P-gp, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3 active transporters. Overall, dapagliflozin is unlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of concurrently administered medications that are P-gp, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3 substrates. Effects of Other Drugs on Dapagliflozin Table 6 shows the effect of coadministered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin. No dose adjustments are recommended for dapagliflozin.

Dapagliflozin did not meaningfully affect the pharmacokinetics of the coadministered drugs.
