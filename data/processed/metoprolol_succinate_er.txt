Drug: metoprolol_succinate_er

=== Drug Interactions ===
7.1 Catecholamine Depleting Drugs Catecholamine depleting drugs (e.g., reserpine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors) may have an additive effect when given with beta-blocking agents. Observe patients treated with metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets plus a catecholamine depletor for evidence of hypotension or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. 7.2 CYP2D6 Inhibitors Drugs that are strong inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and propafenone were shown to double metoprolol concentrations. While there is no information about moderate or weak inhibitors, these too are likely to increase metoprolol concentration. Increases in plasma concentration decrease the cardioselectivity of metoprolol [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Monitor patients closely when the combination cannot be avoided. 7.3 Digitalis, Clonidine, and Calcium Channel Blockers Digitalis glycosides, clonidine, diltiazem, and verapamil slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use with beta-blockers can increase the risk of bradycardia. If clonidine and a beta blocker, such as metoprolol are co-administered, withdraw the beta-blocker several days before the gradual withdrawal of clonidine because beta-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension that can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If replacing clonidine by beta-blocker therapy, delay the introduction of beta-blockers for several days after clonidine administration has stopped.
