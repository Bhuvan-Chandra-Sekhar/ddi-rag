Drug: dabrafenib

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid concurrent administration of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2C8. ( 7.1 ) Concomitant use with agents that are sensitive substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2B6 may result in loss of efficacy of these agents. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on TAFINLAR Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 may increase the concentration of dabrafenib [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Substitution of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 is recommended during treatment with TAFINLAR. If concomitant use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 is unavoidable, monitor patients closely for adverse reactions when taking strong inhibitors. 7.2 Effects of TAFINLAR on Other Drugs Dabrafenib decreased the systemic exposures of midazolam (a CYP3A4 substrate), S-warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate), and R-warfarin (a CYP3A4/CYP1A2 substrate) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Monitor international normalized ratio (INR) levels more frequently in patients receiving warfarin during initiation or discontinuation of dabrafenib. Coadministration of TAFINLAR with other substrates of these enzymes, including dexamethasone or hormonal contraceptives , can result in decreased concentrations and loss of efficacy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8. 3 )] . Substitute for these medications or monitor patients for loss of efficacy if use of these medications is unavoidable.
