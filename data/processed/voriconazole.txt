Drug: voriconazole

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Voriconazole is metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4. Therefore, inhibitors or inducers of these isoenzymes may increase or decrease voriconazole plasma concentrations, respectively. Voriconazole is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, and also inhibits CYP2C19 and CYP2C9. Therefore, voriconazole may increase the plasma concentrations of substances metabolized by these CYP450 isoenzymes. Tables 10 and 11 provide the clinically significant interactions between voriconazole and other medical products.
