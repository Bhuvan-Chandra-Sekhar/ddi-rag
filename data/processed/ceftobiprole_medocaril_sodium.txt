7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide 1B1/1B3 (OATP1B1/OATP1B3) Substrates: ZEVTERA may increase the plasma concentrations of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substrates. Concomitant administration is not recommended ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide 1B1/1B3 (OATP1B1/OATP1B3) Substrates ZEVTERA may increase the plasma concentrations of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substrates. Concomitant administration is not recommended [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Dipstick Tests ZEVTERA may result in false-positive results in dipstick tests (urine protein, ketones, or occult blood). Use alternate clinical laboratory methods of testing to confirm positive tests. Serological Testing Treatment with ZEVTERA has the potential to interfere with serological testing, such as the Coombs test. In clinical studies there was no evidence of hemolytic anemia in adults or children. However, the possibility that hemolytic anemia may occur cannot be ruled out. Patients experiencing anemia during or after treatment should be investigated for this possibility.
