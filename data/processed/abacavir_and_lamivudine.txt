Drug: abacavir_and_lamivudine

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Methadone: An increased methadone dose may be required in a small number of patients. (7.1) Sorbitol: Coadministration of lamivudine and sorbitol may decrease lamivudine concentrations; when possible, avoid chronic coadministration. (7.2) Riociguat: The riociguat dose may need to be reduced. (7.3) 7.1 Methadone In a trial of 11 HIV-1-infected subjects receiving methadone-maintenance therapy with 600 mg of ZIAGEN twice daily (twice the currently recommended dose), oral methadone clearance increased [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . This alteration will not result in a methadone dose modification in the majority of patients; however, an increased methadone dose may be required in a small number of patients. 7.2 Sorbitol Coadministration of single doses of lamivudine and sorbitol resulted in a sorbitol dose-dependent reduction in lamivudine exposures. When possible, avoid use of sorbitol-containing medicines with lamivudine-containing medicines [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.3 Riociguat Coadministration with fixed-dose abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine resulted in increased riociguat exposure, which may increase the risk of riociguat adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The riociguat dose may need to be reduced. See full prescribing information for ADEMPAS (riociguat).
