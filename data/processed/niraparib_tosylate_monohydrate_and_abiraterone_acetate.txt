=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A4 Inducers: Avoid coadministration. ( 7.1 ) CYP2D6 Substrates: Avoid coadministration of AKEEGA with CYP2D6 substrates for which minimal changes in concentration may lead to serious toxicities. If alternative treatments cannot be used, consider a dose reduction of the concomitant CYP2D6 substrate. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on AKEEGA Effect of CYP3A4 Inducers Avoid coadministration with strong CYP3A4 inducers [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Abiraterone is a substrate of CYP3A4. Strong CYP3A4 inducers may decrease abiraterone concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], which may reduce the effectiveness of abiraterone. 7.2 Effects of AKEEGA on Other Drugs CYP2D6 Substrates Avoid coadministration unless otherwise recommended in the Prescribing Information for CYP2D6 substrates for which minimal changes in concentration may lead to serious toxicities. If alternative treatments cannot be used, consider a dose reduction of the concomitant CYP2D6 substrate drug. Abiraterone is a CYP2D6 moderate inhibitor. AKEEGA increases the concentration of CYP2D6 substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], which may increase the risk of adverse reactions related to these substrates. CYP2C8 Substrates Monitor patients for signs of toxicity related to a CYP2C8 substrate for which a minimal change in plasma concentration may lead to serious or life-threatening adverse reactions. Abiraterone is a CYP2C8 inhibitor. AKEEGA increases the concentration of CYP2C8 substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], which may increase the risk of adverse reactions related to these substrates.
