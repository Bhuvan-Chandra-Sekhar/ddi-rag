Drug: irbesartan

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Lithium: Risk of lithium toxicity. ( 7 ) Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) and COX-2 inhibitors: Increased risk of renal impairment. Reduced antihypertensive effects. ( 7 ) Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system: Increased risk of renal impairment, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. ( 7 ) 7.1 Agents Increasing Serum Potassium Coadministration of irbesartan tablets with other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia, sometimes severe. Monitor serum potassium in such patients. 7.2 Lithium Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported with concomitant use of irbesartan and lithium. Monitor lithium levels in patients receiving irbesartan and lithium. 7.3 Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists (including irbesartan) may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving irbesartan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including irbesartan, may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. 7.4 Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on irbesartan tablets and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not coadminister aliskiren with irbesartan tablets in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with irbesartan tablets in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min). 1
