Drug: guanfacine

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 14 contains clinically important drug interactions with guanfacine extended-release tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Table 14: Clinically Important Drug Interactions: Effect of other Drugs on Guanfacine Extended-Release Tablets Concomitant Drug Name or Drug Class Clinical Rationale and Magnitude of Drug Interaction Clinical Recommendation Strong and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, e.g., ketoconazole, fluconazole Guanfacine is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and its plasma concentrations can be significantly affected resulting in an increase in exposure Consider dose reduction [see Dosage and administration (2.7) ] Strong and moderate CYP3A4 inducers, e.g., rifampin, efavirenz Guanfacine is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and its plasma concentrations can be significantly affected resulting in a decrease in exposure Consider dose increase [see Dosage and administration (2.7) ] Strong and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors increase guanfacine exposure. Decrease guanfacine extended-release tablets to 50% of target dosage when coadministered with strong and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors ( 2.7 ). Strong and moderate CYP3A4 inducers decrease guanfacine exposure. Based on patient response, consider titrating guanfacine extended-release tablets dosage up to double the target dosage over 1 to 2 weeks ( 2.7 ).
