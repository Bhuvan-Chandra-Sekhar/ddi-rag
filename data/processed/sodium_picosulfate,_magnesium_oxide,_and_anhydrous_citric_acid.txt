=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that increase risks due to fluid and electrolyte changes. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Drugs That May Increase Risks of Fluid and Electrolyte Abnormalities Use caution when prescribing CLENPIQ for patients with conditions or who are taking other drugs, that increase the risk for fluid and electrolyte disturbances or may increase the risk of renal impairment, seizures, syncope, arrhythmias or QT prolongation in the setting of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4 , 5.5) ] . 7.2 Potential for Reduced Drug Absorption CLENPIQ can reduce the absorption of other co-administered drugs [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] : Administer oral medications at least one hour before of the start of administration of CLENPIQ. Administer tetracycline and fluoroquinolone antibiotics [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ] , iron, digoxin, chlorpromazine, and penicillamine at least 2 hours before and not less than 6 hours after administration of CLENPIQ to avoid chelation with magnesium. 7.3 Antibiotics Prior or concomitant use of antibiotics with CLENPIQ may reduce efficacy of CLENPIQ as conversion of sodium picosulfate to its active metabolite BHPM is mediated by colonic bacteria.
