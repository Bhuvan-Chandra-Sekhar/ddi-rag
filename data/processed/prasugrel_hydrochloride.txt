Drug: prasugrel_hydrochloride

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Opioids: Decreased exposure to prasugrel. Consider use of parenteral antiplatelet agent ( 7.3 ). 7.1 Warfarin Coadministration of Effient and warfarin increases the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs Coadministration of Effient and NSAIDs (used chronically) may increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 7.3 Opioids As with other oral P2Y 12 inhibitors, coadministration of opioid agonists delay and reduce the absorption of prasugrel's active metabolite presumably because of slowed gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Consider the use of a parenteral anti-platelet agent in acute coronary syndrome patients requiring coadministration of morphine or other opioid agonists. 7.4 Other Concomitant Medications Effient can be administered with drugs that are inducers or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Effient can be administered with aspirin (75 mg to 325 mg per day), heparin, GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, statins, digoxin, and drugs that elevate gastric pH, including proton pump inhibitors and H 2 blockers [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .
