Drug: danicopan

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS BCRP substrates: Monitor patients more frequently for adverse reactions and consider dose reduction of the BCRP substrate drug. For rosuvastatin, the dose should not exceed 10 mg once daily ( 7.1 ). P-gp substrates: Dose adjustment might be necessary for P-gp substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions ( 7.2 ). 7.1 BCRP Substrates Danicopan is a Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) inhibitor. Concomitant use of VOYDEYA with a BCRP substrate increases the plasma concentrations of the BCRP substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , which may increase the risk for adverse reactions associated with the BCRP substrate. If used together, monitor patients more frequently for adverse reactions associated with the BCRP substrate, and consider dose reduction of the BCRP substrate according to its prescribing information. Rosuvastatin Danicopan significantly increased rosuvastatin exposure. The dose of rosuvastatin should not exceed 10 mg once daily when concomitantly used with VOYDEYA [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 P-gp Substrates Danicopan is an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Concomitant administration of VOYDEYA with a P-gp substrate may increase the plasma concentration of the P-gp substrate. Dose adjustment might be necessary for P-gp substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .
