=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid coadministration of XOFLUZA with dairy products, calcium-fortified beverages, polyvalent cation-containing laxatives, antacids, or oral supplements (e.g., calcium, iron, magnesium, selenium, or zinc). ( 2.1 , 7.1 ) Live attenuated influenza vaccines may be affected by antivirals. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on XOFLUZA Baloxavir may form a chelate with polyvalent cations such as calcium, aluminum, or magnesium. Coadministration with polyvalent cation-containing products may decrease plasma concentrations of baloxavir [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], which may reduce XOFLUZA efficacy. Avoid coadministration of XOFLUZA with dairy products, calcium-fortified beverages, polyvalent cation-containing laxatives, antacids, or oral supplements (e.g., calcium, iron, magnesium, selenium, or zinc). 7.2 Vaccines The concurrent use of XOFLUZA with intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) has not been evaluated. Concurrent administration of antiviral drugs may inhibit viral replication of LAIV and thereby decrease the effectiveness of LAIV vaccination.
