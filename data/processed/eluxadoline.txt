Drug: eluxadoline

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Tables 2 and 3 include drugs which demonstrated a clinically important drug interaction with VIBERZI or which potentially may result in clinically relevant interactions. Table 2: Established and Other Potentially Clinically Relevant Interactions Affecting VIBERZI OATP1B1 Inhibitors Clinical Impact: Increased exposure to eluxadoline when coadministered with cyclosporine [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] Intervention: Administer VIBERZI at a dose of 75 mg twice daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] and monitor patients for impaired mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery and for other eluxadoline-related adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Examples: cyclosporine, gemfibrozil, antiretrovirals (atazanavir, lopinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, tipranavir), rifampin, eltrombopag Drugs that Cause Constipation Clinical Impact: Increased risk for constipation related adverse reactions and potential for constipation related serious adverse reactions Intervention: Avoid use with other drugs that may cause constipation (see below); loperamide may be used occasionally for acute management of severe diarrhea but avoid chronic use. Discontinue loperamide immediately if constipation occurs. Examples: alosetron, anticholinergics, opioids Table 3: Established and Other Potentially Clinically Relevant Interactions Affecting Drugs Co-Administered with VIBERZI OATP1B1 and BCRP Substrate Clinical Impact: VIBERZI may increase the exposure of co-administered OATP1B1 and BCRP substrates. Increased exposure to rosuvastatin when co-administered with VIBERZI with a potential for increased risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] Intervention: Use the lowest effective dose of rosuvastatin (see prescribing information of rosuvastatin for additional information on recommended dosing). See full prescribing information for clinically relevant interactions. ( 7 )
