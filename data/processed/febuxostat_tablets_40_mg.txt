=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant administration of febuxostat with XO substrate drugs, azathioprine or mercaptopurine could increase plasma concentrations of these drugs resulting in severe toxicity. ( 7 ) 7.1 Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine, also metabolized by XO, showed an increase in exposure of 6-mercaptopurine which may lead to toxicity [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [ see Contraindications ( 4 )]. 7.2 Cytotoxic Chemotherapy Drugs Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been conducted. No data are available regarding the safety of febuxostat during cytotoxic chemotherapy. 7.3 In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Based on drug interaction studies in healthy patients, febuxostat does not have clinically significant interactions with colchicine, naproxen, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin or desipramine [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Therefore, febuxostat may be used concomitantly with these medications.
