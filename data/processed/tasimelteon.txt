Drug: tasimelteon

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine): Avoid use of tasimelteon in combination with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors because of increased exposure ( 7.1 , 12.3 ) Strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin): Avoid use of tasimelteon in combination with rifampin or other CYP3A4 inducers, because of decreased exposure ( 7.2 , 12.3 ) 7.1 Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine) Avoid use of tasimelteon in combination with fluvoxamine or other strong CYP1A2 inhibitors because of a potentially large increase in tasimelteon exposure and greater risk of adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Strong CYP3A4 Inducers (e.g., rifampin) Avoid use of tasimelteon in combination with rifampin or other CYP3A4 inducers because of a potentially large decrease in tasimelteon exposure with reduced efficacy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 Beta-Adrenergic Receptor Antagonists (e.g., acebutolol, metoprolol) Beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists have been shown to reduce the production of melatonin via specific inhibition of beta-1 adrenergic receptors. Nighttime administration of beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists may reduce the efficacy of tasimelteon.
