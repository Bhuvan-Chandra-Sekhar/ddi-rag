7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that lower seizure threshold: Concomitant use may lead to an increased risk of seizures. ( 7.1 ) Drugs with cholinergic effects (e.g., direct or indirect cholinesterase inhibitors): Concomitant use may increase the cholinergic effects of FIRDAPSE and of those drugs and increase the risk of adverse reactions. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Drugs that Lower Seizure Threshold The concomitant use of FIRDAPSE and drugs that lower seizure threshold may lead to an increased risk of seizures [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. The decision to administer FIRDAPSE concomitantly with drugs that lower the seizure threshold should be carefully considered in light of the severity of the associated risks. 7.2 Drugs with Cholinergic Effects The concomitant use of FIRDAPSE and drugs with cholinergic effects (e.g., direct or indirect cholinesterase inhibitors) may increase the cholinergic effects of FIRDAPSE and of those drugs and increase the risk of adverse reactions.
