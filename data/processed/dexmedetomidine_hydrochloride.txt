7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Anesthetics, Sedatives, Hypnotics, Opioids: Enhancement of pharmacodynamic effects. Reduction in dosage of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0.9% sodium chloride injection or the concomitant medication may be required. (7.1) 7.1 Anesthetics, Sedatives, Hypnotics, Opioids Co-administration of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0.9% sodium chloride injection with anesthetics, sedatives, hypnotics, and opioids is likely to lead to an enhancement of effects. Specific studies have confirmed these effects with sevoflurane, isoflurane, propofol, alfentanil, and midazolam. No pharmacokinetic interactions between dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0.9% sodium chloride injection and isoflurane, propofol, alfentanil and midazolam have been demonstrated. However, due to possible pharmacodynamic interactions, when co-administered with dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0.9% sodium chloride injection, a reduction in dosage of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0.9% sodium chloride injection or the concomitant anesthetic, sedative, hypnotic or opioid may be required. 7.2 Neuromuscular Blockers In one study of 10 healthy adult volunteers, administration of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0.9% sodium chloride injection for 45 minutes at a plasma concentration of one ng/mL resulted in no clinically meaningful increases in the magnitude of neuromuscular blockade associated with rocuronium administration.
