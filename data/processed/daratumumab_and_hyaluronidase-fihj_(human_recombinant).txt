=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Effects of Daratumumab on Laboratory Tests Interference with Indirect Antiglobulin Tests (Indirect Coombs Test) Daratumumab binds to CD38 on RBCs and interferes with compatibility testing, including antibody screening and cross matching. Daratumumab interference mitigation methods include treating reagent RBCs with dithiothreitol (DTT) to disrupt daratumumab binding [see References (15) ] or genotyping. Since the Kell blood group system is also sensitive to DTT treatment, supply K-negative units after ruling out or identifying alloantibodies using DTT-treated RBCs. If an emergency transfusion is required, administer non-cross-matched ABO/RhD-compatible RBCs per local blood bank practices. Interference with Serum Protein Electrophoresis and Immunofixation Tests Daratumumab may be detected on serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation (IFE) assays used for monitoring disease monoclonal immunoglobulins (M protein). False positive SPE and IFE assay results may occur for patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein impacting initial assessment of complete responses by International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria. In DARZALEX FASPRO-treated patients with persistent very good partial response, where daratumumab interference is suspected, consider using a FDA-approved daratumumab-specific IFE assay to distinguish daratumumab from any remaining endogenous M protein in the patient's serum, to facilitate determination of a complete response.
