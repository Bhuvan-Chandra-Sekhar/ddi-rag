=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A Inhibitors : Avoid coadministration or reduce ICLUSIG dose if coadministration cannot be avoided. ( 2.3 , 7.1 ) Strong CYP3A Inducers : Avoid coadministration. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on ICLUSIG Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Coadministration of ICLUSIG with a strong CYP3A inhibitor increases ponatinib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , which may increase the risk of ICLUSIG adverse reactions. Avoid coadministration of ICLUSIG with strong CYP3A inhibitors. If coadministration of ICLUSIG with strong CYP3A inhibitors cannot be avoided, reduce the ICLUSIG dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Strong CYP3A Inducers Coadministration of ICLUSIG with a strong CYP3A inducer decreases ponatinib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Avoid coadministration of ICLUSIG with strong CYP3A inducers unless the benefit outweighs the risk of decreased ponatinib exposure. Monitor patients for reduced efficacy. Selection of concomitant medication with no or minimal CYP3A induction potential is recommended.
