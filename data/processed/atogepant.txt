=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Recommended dosage modifications: Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors ( 2.2 , 7.1 ): Episodic or chronic migraine: 10 mg once daily Strong CYP3A4 Inducers ( 2.2 , 7.2 ): Episodic migraine: 60 mg once daily (monitor for reduced efficacy). Chronic migraine: Not recommended. Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers ( 2.2 , 7.2 ): Episodic migraine: 60 mg once daily. Chronic migraine: Not recommended. Weak CYP3A4 Inducers ( 2.2 , 7.2 ): Episodic migraine: 30 mg or 60 mg once daily. Chronic migraine: 60 mg once daily. OATP Inhibitors ( 2.2 , 7.3 ): Episodic migraine: 10 mg or 30 mg once daily. Chronic migraine: 30 mg once daily. 7.1 CYP3A4 Inhibitors Coadministration of QULIPTA with itraconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, resulted in a significant increase in exposure of atogepant in healthy subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The recommended dosage of QULIPTA with concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is 10 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ] . No dosage adjustment of QULIPTA is needed with concomitant use of moderate or weak CYP3A4 inhibitors. 7.2 CYP3A4 Inducers Coadministration of QULIPTA with steady-state rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer and OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 inhibitor, resulted in a significant decrease in exposure of atogepant in healthy subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Concomitant administration of QULIPTA with moderate inducers of CYP3A4 can also result in decreased exposure of atogepant. Coadministration of QULIPTA with steady-state topiramate, a weak CYP3A4 inducer, resulted in decreased exposure of atogepant in healthy subjects [see Clinical Phar macology ( 12.3 )] . For episodic migraine, the recommended dosage of QULIPTA with concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers is 60 mg once daily. During concomitant use of QULIPTA with strong CYP3A4 inducers, monitor monthly for signs of reduced efficacy, and consider alternative therapies if a reduction in efficacy is observed. The recommended dosage of QULIPTA with concomitant use of weak CYP3A4 inducers is 30 mg or 60 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ] . For chronic migraine, concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers with QULIPTA is not recommended. The recommended dosage of QULIPTA with concomitant use of weak CYP3A4 inducers is 60 mg once daily. Monitor monthly for signs of reduced efficacy, and consider alternative therapies if a reduction in efficacy is observed [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ] . 7 .3 OATP Inhibitors Coadministration of QULIPTA with single dose rifampin, an OATP inhibitor, resulted in a significant increase in exposure of atogepant in healthy subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . For episodic migraine, the recommended dosage of QULIPTA with concomitant use of OATP inhibitors is 10 mg or 30 mg once daily. For chronic migraine, the recommended dosage of QULIPTA with concomitant use of OATP inhibitors is 30 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ] .
