=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Drugs with Nephrotoxic or Ototoxic Potential Avoid concurrent and/or sequential use of Tobramycin for Injection with other drugs with nephrotoxic and/or ototoxic potential. 7.2 Diuretics Some diuretics can enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering concentrations in serum and tissue and causing dehydration. Monitor serum concentrations, renal function, serum electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, calcium and phosphate, urine output and urinalysis, and signs of auditory or vestibular toxicity in patients concomitantly administered diuretics. 7.3 Drugs with Neuromuscular Blockade or Neurotoxic Potential Prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur in patients concomitantly receiving neuromuscular blocking agents with Tobramycin for Injection [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] .
