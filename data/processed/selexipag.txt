Drug: selexipag

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., clopidogrel, deferasirox and teriflunomide) increase exposure to the active metabolite of UPTRAVI. Reduce the dosing of UPTRAVI to once daily ( 2.6 , 7.1 , 12.3 ). CYP2C8 inducers (e.g., rifampin) decrease exposure to the active metabolite. Increase up to twice the dose of UPTRAVI ( 7.2 , 12.3 ) 7.1 CYP2C8 Inhibitors Concomitant administration with gemfibrozil, a strong inhibitor of CYP2C8, doubled the exposure to selexipag and increased exposure to the active metabolite by approximately 11-fold. Concomitant administration of UPTRAVI with strong inhibitors of CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil) is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Concomitant administration of UPTRAVI tablets with clopidogrel, a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C8, had no relevant effect on the exposure to selexipag and increased the exposure to the active metabolite by approximately 2.7-fold [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Reduce the dosing of UPTRAVI to once daily in patients on a moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . 7.2 CYP2C8 Inducers Concomitant administration with an inducer of CYP2C8 and UGT 1A3 and 2B7 enzymes (rifampin) halved exposure to the active metabolite. Increase dose up to twice of UPTRAVI when co-administered with rifampin. Reduce UPTRAVI when rifampin is stopped [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .
