=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Moderate and Strong CYP3A Inhibitors : For adult and pediatric patients 2 years and older, reduce the dose of ROZLYTREK if coadministration of moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors cannot be avoided. ( 2.8 , 7.1 ) For pediatric patients less than 2 years, avoid coadministration with ROZLYTREK. ( 7.1 ) Moderate and Strong CYP3A Inducers : Avoid coadministration with ROZLYTREK. ( 7.1 ) Drugs That Prolong QTc Interval : Avoid concomitant use with ROZLYTREK. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on ROZLYTREK Moderate and Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Adults and Pediatric Patients 2 Years and Older Coadministration of ROZLYTREK with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor increases entrectinib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], which could increase the frequency or severity of adverse reactions. Avoid coadministration of strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors with ROZLYTREK. If coadministration is unavoidable, reduce the ROZLYTREK dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Pediatric Patients less than 2 Years Avoid coadministration of ROZLYTREK with moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Avoid grapefruit products during treatment with ROZLYTREK, as they contain inhibitors of CYP3A. Moderate and Strong CYP3A Inducers Coadministration of ROZLYTREK with a strong or moderate CYP3A inducer decreases entrectinib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], which may reduce ROZLYTREK efficacy. Avoid coadministration of strong and moderate CYP3A inducers with ROZLYTREK . 7.2 Drugs That Prolong QTc Interval QTc interval prolongation can occur with ROZLYTREK. Avoid coadministration of ROZLYTREK with other products with a known potential to prolong QT/QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] .
