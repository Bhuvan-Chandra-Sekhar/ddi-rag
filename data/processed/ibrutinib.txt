Drug: ibrutinib

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CYP3A Inhibitors: Modify IMBRUVICA dose as described ( 2.3 , 7.1 ). CYP3A Inducers: Avoid coadministration with strong CYP3A inducers ( 7.2 ). 7.1 Effect of CYP3A Inhibitors on Ibrutinib The coadministration of IMBRUVICA with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor may increase ibrutinib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Increased ibrutinib concentrations may increase the risk of drug-related toxicity. Dose modifications of IMBRUVICA are recommended when used concomitantly with posaconazole, voriconazole and moderate CYP3A inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. Avoid concomitant use of other strong CYP3A inhibitors. Interrupt IMBRUVICA if these inhibitors will be used short-term (such as anti-infectives for seven days or less) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) ] . Avoid grapefruit and Seville oranges during IMBRUVICA treatment, as these contain strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP3A. 7.2 Effect of CYP3A Inducers on Ibrutinib The coadministration of IMBRUVICA with strong CYP3A inducers may decrease ibrutinib concentrations. Avoid coadministration with strong CYP3A inducers [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] .
