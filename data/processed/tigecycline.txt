Drug: tigecycline

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Warfarin: Suitable anticoagulation test should be monitored if tigecycline for injection is administered to patients receiving warfarin. ( 7.1 ) Calcineurin Inhibitors: Serum concentrations of calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., tacrolimus, cyclosporine) should be monitored during treatment with tigecycline for injection due to risk of toxicity. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Warfarin Prothrombin time or other suitable anticoagulation test should be monitored if tigecycline is administered with warfarin [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.2 Calcineurin Inhibitors Concomitant use of tigecycline for injection and calcineurin inhibitors such as tacrolimus or cyclosporine may lead to an increase in serum trough concentrations of the calcineurin inhibitors. Therefore, serum concentrations of the calcineurin inhibitor should be monitored during treatment with tigecycline for injection to avoid drug toxicity. 7.3 Oral Contraceptives Concurrent use of antibacterial drugs with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective.
