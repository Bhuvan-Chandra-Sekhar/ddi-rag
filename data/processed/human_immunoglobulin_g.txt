=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTION The passive transfer of antibodies may: Interfere with the response to live virus vaccines, such as measles, rubella, mumps and varicella. ( 7 ) Result in misleading positive results in serological testing. ( 5.9 , 7 ) 7.1 Effect of QIVIGY on Live attenuated virus vaccines Immune globulin administration may transiently impair the efficacy of live attenuated virus vaccines such as measles, mumps, rubella, s and varicella because the continued presence of high levels of passively acquired antibody may interfere with an active antibody response. Inform the immunizing physician of recent therapy with QIVIGY so that appropriate measures may be taken. 7.2 Effect of QIVIGY on Serological Testing Passive transmission of antibodies through immune globulin administration may interfere with some serological testing [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ]. 7.3 Effect of Loop diuretics on QIVIGY The use of loop diuretics should be avoided. Concomitant use of loop diuretics with IGIV may contribute to an increased blood viscosity and subsequently increase the risk of thromboembolic events.
