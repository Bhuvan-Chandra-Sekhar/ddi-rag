7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See full prescribing information for details regarding concomitant use of rosuvastatin tablets with other drugs that increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. ( 2.6 , 7.1 ) Aluminum and Magnesium Hydroxide Combination Antacids : Administer rosuvastatin tablets at least 2 hours after the antacid. ( 2.6 , 7.2 ) Wafarin: Obtain INR prior to starting rosuvastatin tablets. Monitor INR frequently until stable upon initiation, dose titration or discontinuation. ( 7.3 ) 7.1 Drug Interactions that Increase the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis with Rosuvastatin Rosuvastatin is a substrate of CYP2C9 and transporters (such as OATP1B1, BCRP). Rosuvastatin plasma levels can be significantly increased with concomitant administration of inhibitors of CYP2C9 and transporters. Table 5 includes a list of drugs that increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when used concomitantly with rosuvastatin and instructions for preventing or managing them [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Table 5: Drug Interactions that Increase the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis with Rosuvastatin Cyclosporine Clinical Impact: Cyclosporine increased rosuvastatin exposure 7-fold. The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant use of cyclosporine or gemfibrozil with rosuvastatin. Intervention: If used concomitantly, do not exceed a dose of rosuvastatin 5 mg once daily . Teriflunomide Clinical Impact: Teriflunomide increased rosuvastatin exposure more than 2.5-fold. The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant use. Intervention: In patients taking teriflunomide, do not exceed a dose of rosuvastatin 10 mg once daily. Enasidenib Clinical Impact: Enasidenib increased rosuvastatin exposure more than 2.4-fold. The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant use. Intervention: In patients taking enasidenib, do not exceed a dose of rosuvastatin 10 mg once daily . Capmatinib Clinical Impact: Capmatinib increased rosuvastatin exposure more than 2.1-fold. The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant use. Intervention: In patients taking capmatinib, do not exceed a dose of rosuvastatin 10 mg once daily . Fostamatinib Clinical Impact: Fostamatinib increased rosuvastatin exposure more than 2.0-fold. The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant use. Intervention: In patients taking fostamatinib, do not exceed a dose of rosuvastatin 20 mg once daily . Febuxostat Clinical Impact: Febuxostat increased rosuvastatin exposure more than 1.9-fold. The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant use. Intervention: In patients taking febuxostat, do not exceed a dose of rosuvastatin 20 mg once daily . Gemfibrozil Clinical Impact: Gemfibrozil significantly increased rosuvastatin exposure and gemfibrozil may cause myopathy when given alone. The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant use of gemfibrozil with rosuvastatin. Intervention: Avoid concomitant use of gemfibrozil with rosuvastatin. If used concomitantly, initiate rosuvastatin at 5 mg once daily and do not exceed a dose of rosuvastatin 10 mg once daily . Tafamidis Clinical Impact: Tafamidis significantly increased rosuvastatin exposure and tafamidis may cause myopathy when given alone. The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant use of tafamidis with rosuvastatin. Intervention: Avoid concomitant use of tafamidis with rosuvastatin. If used concomitantly, initiate rosuvastatin at 5 mg once daily and do not exceed a dose of rosuvastatin 20 mg once daily. Monitor for signs of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis if used concomitantly with rosuvastatin . Anti-Viral Medications Clinical Impact: Rosuvastatin plasma levels were significantly increased with concomitant administration of many anti-viral drugs, which increases the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Intervention: Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir Avoid concomitant use with rosuvastatin. Simeprevir Dasabuvir/ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir Elbasvir/grazoprevir Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir Atazanavir/ritonavir Lopinavir/ritonavir Initiate with rosuvastatin 5 mg once daily, and do not exceed a dose of rosuvastatin 10 mg once daily. Darolutamide Clinical Impact: Darolutamide increased rosuvastatin exposure more than 5-fold. The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant use . Intervention: In patients taking darolutamide, do not exceed a dose of rosuvastatin 5 mg once daily . Regorafenib Clinical Impact: Regorafenib increased rosuvastatin exposure and may increase the risk of myopathy. Intervention: In patients taking regorafenib, do not exceed a dose of rosuvastatin 10 mg once daily . Fenofibrates (e.g., fenofibrate and fenofibric acid) Clinical Impact: Fibrates may cause myopathy when given alone. The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant use of fibrates with rosuvastatin. Intervention: Consider if the benefit of using fibrates concomitantly with rosuvastatin outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. If concomitant use is decided, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy, particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dose titration of either drug. Niacin Clinical Impact: Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have occurred with concomitant use of lipid-modifying doses (≥1 g/day) of niacin with rosuvastatin. Intervention: Consider if the benefit of using lipid-modifying doses (≥1 g/day) of niacin concomitantly with rosuvastatin outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. If concomitant use is decided, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy, particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dose titration of either drug. Colchicine Clinical Impact: Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported with concomitant use of colchicine with rosuvastatin. Intervention: Consider if the benefit of using colchicine concomitantly with rosuvastatin outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. If concomitant use is decided, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy, particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dose titration of either drug. 7.2 Drug Interactions that Decrease the Efficacy of Rosuvastatin Table 6 presents drug interactions that may decrease the efficacy of rosuvastatin and instructions for preventing or managing them. Table 6: Drug Interactions that Decrease the Efficacy of Rosuvastatin Antacids Clinical Impact: Concomitant aluminum and magnesium hydroxide combination antacid administration decreased the mean exposure of rosuvastatin 50% [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Intervention: In patients taking antacid, administer rosuvastatin at least 2 hours after the antacid . 7.3 Rosuvastatin Effects on Other Drugs Table 7 presents rosuvastatin’s effect on other drugs and instructions for preventing or managing them. Table 7: Rosuvastatin Effects on Other Drugs Warfarin Clinical Impact: Rosuvastatin significantly increased the INR in patients receiving warfarin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Intervention: In patients taking warfarin, obtain an INR before starting rosuvastatin and frequently enough after initiation, dose titration or discontinuation to ensure that no significant alteration in INR occurs. Once the INR is stable, monitor INR at regularly recommended intervals.
