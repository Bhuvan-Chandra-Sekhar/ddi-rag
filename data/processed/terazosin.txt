Drug: terazosin

=== Drug Interactions ===
Drug Interactions In controlled trials, terazosin has been added to diuretics, and several beta-adrenergic blockers; no unexpected interactions were observed. Terazosin has also been used in patients on a variety of concomitant therapies; while these were not formal interaction studies, no interactions were observed. Terazosin has been used concomitantly in at least 50 patients on the following drugs or drug classes: 1) analgesic/anti-inflammatory (e.g., acetaminophen, aspirin, codeine, ibuprofen, indomethacin). 2) antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole). 3) anticholinergic/sympathomimetics (e.g., phenylephrine hydrochloride, phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride). 4) antigout (e.g., allopurinol). 5) antihistamines (e.g., chlorpheniramine). 6) cardiovascular agents (e.g., atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, methyclothiazide, propranolol). 7) corticosteroids. 8) gastrointestinal agents (e.g., antacids). 9) hypoglycemics. 10) sedatives and tranquilizers (e.g., diazepam). Use with Other Drugs In a study (n = 24) where terazosin and verapamil were administered concomitantly, terazosin's mean AUC 0-24 increased 11% after the first verapamil dose and after 3 weeks of verapamil treatment it increased by 24% with associated increases in C max (25%) and C min (32%) means. Terazosin mean T max decreased from 1.3 hours to 0.8 hours after 3 weeks of verapamil treatment. Statistically significant differences were not found in the verapamil level with and without terazosin. In a study (n = 6) where terazosin and captopril were administered concomitantly, plasma disposition of captopril was not influenced by concomitant administration of terazosin and terazosin maximum plasma concentrations increased linearly with dose at steady-state after administration of terazosin plus captopril (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Terazosin was devoid of mutagenic potential when evaluated in vivo and in vitro (the Ames test, in vivo cytogenetics, the dominant lethal test in mice, in vivo Chinese hamster chromosome aberration test and V79 forward mutation assay). Terazosin, administered in the feed to rats at doses of 8 mg/kg/day, 40 mg/kg/day, and 250 mg/kg/day (70 mg/m 2 /day, 350 mg/m 2 /day, and 2,100 mg/m 2 /day), for two years, was associated with a statistically significant increase in benign adrenal medullary tumors of male rats exposed to the 250 mg/kg dose. This dose is 175 times the maximum recommended human dose of 20 mg (12 mg/m 2 ). Female rats were unaffected. Terazosin was not oncogenic in mice when administered in feed for 2 years at a maximum tolerated dose of 32 mg/kg/day (110 mg/m 2 ; 9 times the maximum recommended human dose). The absence of mutagenicity in a battery of tests, of tumorigenicity of any cell type in the mouse carcinogenicity assay, of increased total tumor incidence in either species, and of proliferative adrenal lesions in female rats, suggests a male rat species-specific event. Numerous other diverse pharmaceutical and chemical compounds have also been associated with benign adrenal medullary tumors in male rats without supporting evidence for carcinogenicity in man. The effect of terazosin on fertility was assessed in a standard fertility/reproductive performance study in which male and female rats were administered oral doses of 8 mg/kg/day, 30 mg/kg/day and 120 mg/kg/day. Four of 20 male rats given 30 mg/kg (240 mg/m 2 ; 20 times the maximum recommended human dose) and five of 19 male rats given 120 mg/kg (960 mg/m 2 ; 80 times the maximum recommended human dose) failed to sire a litter. Testicular weights and morphology were unaffected by treatment. Vaginal smears at 30 mg/kg/day and 120 mg/kg/day, however, appeared to contain less sperm than smears from control matings and good correlation was reported between sperm count and subsequent pregnancy. Oral administration of terazosin for one or two years elicited a statistically significant increase in the incidence of testicular atrophy in rats exposed to 40 mg/kg/day and 250 mg/kg/day (29 times and 175 times the maximum recommended human dose), but not in rats exposed to 8 mg/kg/day (> 6 times the maximum recommended human dose). Testicular atrophy was also observed in dogs dosed with 300 mg/kg/day (> 500 times the maximum recommended human dose) for three months but not after one year when dosed with 20 mg/kg/day (38 times the maximum recommended human dose). This lesion has also been seen with prazosin hydrochloride, another (marketed) selective-alpha-1 blocking agent.
