=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Interference with Rapid Antigen Detection RSV Diagnostic Assays Clesrovimab-cfor may interfere with some immunologically-based RSV diagnostic assays (i.e., rapid antigen tests) as observed in laboratory studies.

Clesrovimab-cfor does not interfere with RT-PCR diagnostic assays [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .
