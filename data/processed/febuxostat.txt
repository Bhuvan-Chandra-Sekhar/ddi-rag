Drug: febuxostat

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant administration of febuxostat tablets with XO substrate drugs, azathioprine or mercaptopurine could increase plasma concentrations of these drugs resulting in severe toxicity. (7) 7.1 Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. Based on a drug interaction study in healthy patients, febuxostat altered the metabolism of theophylline (a substrate of XO) in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Therefore, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat tablets with theophylline. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine, also metabolized by XO, showed an increase in exposure of 6-mercaptopurine which may lead to toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat tablets with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat tablets are contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.2 Cytotoxic Chemotherapy Drugs Drug interaction studies of febuxostat tablets with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been conducted. No data are available regarding the safety of febuxostat tablets during cytotoxic chemotherapy. 7.3 In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Based on drug interaction studies in healthy patients, febuxostat tablets do not have clinically significant interactions with colchicine, naproxen, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin or desipramine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Therefore, febuxostat tablets may be used concomitantly with these medications.
