=== Drug Interactions ===
Drug Interactions Beta-Adrenergic Blocking Agents Patients who are receiving a beta-adrenergic blocking agent orally and Timolol maleate ophthalmic gel forming solution should be observed for potential additive effects of beta-blockade, both systemic and on intraocular pressure. The concomitant use of two topical beta-adrenergic blocking agents is not recommended. Calcium Antagonists Caution should be used in the coadministration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, such as Timolol maleate ophthalmic gel forming solution, and oral or intravenous calcium antagonists because of possible atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure, or hypotension. In patients with impaired cardiac function, coadministration should be avoided. Catecholamine-Depleting Drugs Close observation of the patient is recommended when a beta blocker is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as reserpine, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may result in vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. Digitalis and Calcium Antagonists The concomitant use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents with digitalis and calcium antagonists may have additive effects in prolonging atrioventricular conduction time. CYP2D6 Inhibitors Potentiated systemic beta-blockade (e.g., decreased heart rate, depression) has been reported during combined treatment with CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g. quinidine, SSRIs) and timolol. Clonidine Oral beta-adrenergic blocking agents may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. There have been no reports of exacerbation of rebound hypertension with ophthalmic timolol maleate. Injectable Epinephrine [See PRECAUTIONS, General, Anaphylaxis ]
