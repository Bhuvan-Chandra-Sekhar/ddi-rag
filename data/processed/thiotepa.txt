Drug: thiotepa

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Effect of Cytochrome CYP3A Inhibitors and Inducers In vitro studies suggest that thiotepa is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 to its active metabolite TEPA. Avoid coadministration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir) and strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin) with thiotepa due to the potential effects on efficacy and toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Consider alternative medications with no or minimal potential to inhibit or induce CYP3A4. If concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 modulators cannot be avoided, closely monitor for adverse drug reactions. 7.2 Effect of Thiotepa on Cytochrome CYP2B6 Substrates In vitro studies suggest that thiotepa inhibits CYP2B6. Thiotepa may increase the exposure of drugs that are substrates of CYP2B6 in patients; however, the clinical relevance of this in vitro interaction is unknown [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . The administration of thiotepa with cyclophosphamide in patients reduces the conversion of cyclophosphamide to the active metabolite, 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide; the effect appears sequence dependent with a greater reduction in the conversion to 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide when thiotepa is administered 1.5 hours prior to the intravenous administration of cyclophosphamide compared to administration of thiotepa after intravenous cyclophosphamide [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . The reduction in 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide levels may potentially reduce efficacy of cyclophosphamide treatment.
