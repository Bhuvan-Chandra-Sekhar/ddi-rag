Drug: sodium_oxybate

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use with divalproex sodium: An initial reduction in sodium oxybate oral solution dose of at least 20% is recommended (2.5, 7.2). 7.1 Alcohol, Sedative Hypnotics, and CNS Depressants Sodium oxybate oral solution is contraindicated for use in combination with alcohol or sedative hypnotics. Use of other CNS depressants may potentiate the CNS-depressant effects of sodium oxybate oral solution [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 7.2 Divalproex Sodium Concomitant use of sodium oxybate oral solution with divalproex sodium results in an increase in systemic exposure to GHB, which was shown to cause a greater impairment on some tests of attention and working memory in a clinical study [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. An initial dose reduction of sodium oxybate oral solution is recommended when used concomitantly with divalproex sodium [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Prescribers are advised to monitor patient response closely and adjust dose accordingly if concomitant use of sodium oxybate oral solution and divalproex sodium is warranted.
