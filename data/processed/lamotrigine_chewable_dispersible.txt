=== Drug Interactions ===
7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Significant drug interactions with lamotrigine are summarized in this section. Additional details of these drug interaction studies are provided in the Clinical Pharmacology section [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Table 13. Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions Concomitant Drug Effect on Concentration of Lamotrigine or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment Estrogen-containing oral contraceptivepreparation containing 30 mcg ethinylestradiol and 150 mcg levonorgestrel ↓ lamotrigine ↓ levonorgestrel Decreased lamotrigine levels approximately 50%. Decrease in levonorgestrel component by 19%. Carbamazepine and carbamazepine epoxide ↓ lamotrigine ? carbamazepine epoxide Addition of carbamazepine decreases lamotrigine concentration approximately 40%. May increase carbamazepine epoxide levels. Lopinavir/ritonavir ↓ lamotrigine Decreased lamotrigine concentration approximately 50%. Atazanavir/ritonavir ↓ lamotrigine Decreased lamotrigine AUC approximately 32%. Phenobarbital/primidone ↓ lamotrigine Decreased lamotrigine concentration approximately 40%. Phenytoin ↓ lamotrigine Decreased lamotrigine concentration approximately 40%. Rifampin ↓ lamotrigine Decreased lamotrigine AUC approximately 40%. Valproate ↑ lamotrigine ? valproate Increased lamotrigine concentrations slightly more than 2-fold. There are conflicting study results regarding effect of lamotrigine on valproate concentrations: 1) a mean 25% decrease in valproate concentrations in healthy volunteers, 2) no change in valproate concentrations in controlled clinical trials in patients with epilepsy. ↓ = Decreased (induces lamotrigine gluronidation). ↑= Increased (inhibits lamotrigine glucuronidation). ?= Conflicting data. Effect of Lamotrigine on Organic Cationic Transporter 2 Substrates Lamotrigine is an inhibitor of renal tubular secretion via organic cationic transporter 2 (OCT2) proteins [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . This may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs that are substantially excreted via this route. Coadministration of lamotrigine with OCT2 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., dofetilide) is not recommended. · Valproate increases lamotrigine concentrations more than 2-fold. (7, 12.3) · Carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, and rifampin decrease lamotrigine concentrations by approximately 40%. (7, 12.3) · Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives decrease lamotrigine concentrations by approximately 50%. (7, 12.3) · Protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/lopinavir decrease lamotrigine exposure by approximately 50% and 32%, respectively. (7, 12.3) . Coadministration with organic cationic transporter 2 substrates with narrow therapeutic index is not recommended (7, 12.3)
