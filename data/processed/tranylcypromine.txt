=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See Full Prescribing Information for a list of products, foods and beverages that can interact with tranylcypromine tablets (7) 7.1 Clinically-Significant Drug Interactions Tables 3 and 4 lists drug classes and individual products, respectively, with a potential for interaction with tranylcypromine tablets, describes the predominant observed or anticipated risks, and provides advice on concomitant use. Given serious adverse reactions with multiple agents, patients should avoid taking over-the-counter medications or dietary supplements without prior consultation with a healthcare provider able to provide advice on the potential for interactions. T ime to Start Tranylcypromine Tablets after Discontinuation of a Contraindicated Drug For products that are contraindicated with tranylcypromine tablets, a time period of 4 to 5 half-lives of the other product or any active metabolite should elapse before starting treatment with tranylcypromine tablets. After stopping treatment with an MAO inhibitor antidepressant, a time period of at least 1 week or 4 to 5 half-lives of the other MAO inhibitor (whichever is longer) should elapse before starting treatment with tranylcypromine tablets because of the risk for clinically significant adverse reactions after discontinuation due to persistent MAO inhibition [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] . This period can be several weeks long (e.g., a minimum of 5 weeks for fluoxetine given fluoxetine’s long half-life). Refer to the prescribing information of the contraindicated product for relevant information. T ime to Start Contraindicated Drug after Discontinuation of Tranylcypromine Tablets The potential for interactions persists after discontinuation of tranylcypromine tablets until MAO activity has sufficiently recovered. Inhibition of MAO may persist up to 10 days following discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] . After stopping tranylcypromine tablets, at least 1 week should elapse before starting another MAOI (intended to treat MDD) or other contraindicated antidepressants. Refer to the prescribing information of any agent considered for subsequent use for recommendations on the duration of a waiting period after discontinuation of a MAO inhibitor. If in the absence of therapeutic alternatives and emergency treatment with a contraindicated drug (e.g., linezolid, intravenous methylene blue, direct-acting sympathomimetic drugs such as epinephrine) becomes necessary and cannot be delayed, discontinue tranylcypromine tablets as soon as possible before initiating treatment with the other agent, and monitor closely for adverse reactions.

As a result of this inhibition, large amounts of tyramine may enter the systemic circulation and precipitate a sudden elevation in blood pressure or hypertensive crisis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Instruct tranylcypromine tablet-treated patients to avoid foods and beverages with significant tyramine content during treatment with tranylcypromine tablets or within 2 weeks of stopping treatment (see Table 5 for a list of food and beverages containing significant amounts of tyramine). Table 5: Foods and Beverages with and without Significant Amounts of Tyramine C lass of F ood or Beverage Tyramine-Rich Foods and Beverages to Avoid Acce ptable Foods and Dr inks, Containing No or Little Tyramine Meat, Poultry, and Fish Air dried, aged and fermented meats, sausages and salamis (including cacciatore, hard salami and mortadella); pickled herring; and any spoiled or improperly stored meat, poultry, and fish (e.g., foods that have undergone changes in coloration, odor, or become moldy); spoiled or improperly stored animal livers Fresh meat, poultry, and fish, including fresh processed meats (e.g., lunch meats, hot dogs, breakfast sausage, and cooked sliced ham) Vegetables Broad bean pods (fava bean pods) All other vegetables Dairy Aged cheeses Processed cheeses, mozzarella, ricotta cheese, cottage cheese, and yogurt Beverages All varieties of tap beer and beers that have not been pasteurized so as to allow for ongoing fermentation and excessive amounts of caffeine. Concomitant use of alcohol with tranylcypromine tablets is not recommended. (Bottled and canned beers and wines contain little or no tyramine.)
