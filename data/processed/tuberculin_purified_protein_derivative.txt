=== Drug Interactions ===
Drug Interactions Reactivity to the test may be depressed or suppressed in persons who are receiving corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents. (7) Reactivity to TUBERSOL may be temporarily depressed by certain live virus vaccines (measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, yellow fever, and varicella). If a parenteral live attenuated virus vaccine has been administered recently, tuberculin testing should be delayed for >1 month after vaccination. (7)(11) (See Interpretation of the Test .) When tuberculin screening is required at the same time as a measles-containing vaccine or other parenteral live attenuated virus vaccine, simultaneous administration of TUBERSOL and the vaccine at separate sites is the preferred option.
