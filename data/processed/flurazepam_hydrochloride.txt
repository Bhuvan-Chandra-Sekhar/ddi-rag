Drug: flurazepam_hydrochloride

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, and death. ( 7.1 ) CNS Depressants: Downward dose adjustment may be necessary due to additive effects. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Opioids The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids increases the risk of respiratory depression because of actions at different receptor sites in the CNS that control respiration. Benzodiazepines interact at GABA A sites, and opioids interact primarily at mu receptors. When benzodiazepines and opioids are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression exists. Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids, and follow patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation. 7.2 CNS Depressants Benzodiazepines, including flurazepam, produce additive CNS depressant effects when co-administered with ethanol or other CNS depressants (e.g., psychotropic medications, anticonvulsants, antihistamines). Downward dose adjustment of flurazepam and/or concomitant CNS depressants may be necessary because of additive effects.
