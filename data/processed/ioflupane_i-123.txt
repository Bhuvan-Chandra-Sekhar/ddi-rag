Drug: ioflupane_i-123

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Ioflupane I 123 binds to the dopamine transporter [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ]. Drugs that bind to the dopamine transporter with high affinity may interfere with the image obtained following Ioflupane I 123 Injection administration. These potentially interfering drugs consist of: amoxapine, amphetamine, armodafinil, benztropine, bupropion, buspirone, cocaine, mazindol, methamphetamine, methylphenidate, modafinil, norephedrine, phentermine, phenylpropanolamine, selegiline, and sertraline. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (paroxetine and citalopram) may increase or decrease ioflupane binding to the dopamine transporter. Whether discontinuation of these drugs prior to Ioflupane I 123 Injection administration may minimize the interference with a Ioflupane I 123 Injection image is unknown. The impact of dopamine agonists and antagonists upon Ioflupane I 123 Injection imaging results has not been established. Amoxapine, amphetamine, armodafinil, benztropine, bupropion, buspirone, cocaine, mazindol, methamphetamine, methylphenidate, modafinil norephedrine, phentermine, phenylpropanolamine, selegiline, sertraline, citalopram and paroxetine may interfere with Ioflupane I 123 Injection imaging. The effects of dopamine agonists and antagonists on Ioflupane I 123 Injection imaging have not been established. ( 7 )
