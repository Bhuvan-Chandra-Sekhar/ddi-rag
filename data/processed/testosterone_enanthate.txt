Drug: testosterone_enanthate

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Androgens may decrease blood glucose, and therefore may decrease insulin requirements in diabetic patients ( 7.1 ). Changes in anticoagulant activity may be seen with androgens. More frequent monitoring of international normalized ratio (INR) and prothrombin time is recommended in patients taking warfarin ( 7.2 ). Use of testosterone with corticosteroids may result in increased fluid retention. Use with caution, particularly in patients with cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease ( 7.3 ). Concomitant administration of medications that are known to increase BP with XYOSTED may lead to additional increases in BP ( 7.4 ). 7.1 Insulin Changes in insulin sensitivity or glycemic control may occur in patients treated with androgens. In diabetic patients, the metabolic effects of androgens may decrease blood glucose and, therefore, may necessitate a decrease in the dose of anti-diabetic medication. 7.2 Oral Anticoagulants Changes in anticoagulant activity may be seen with androgens, therefore more frequent monitoring of international normalized ratio (INR) and prothrombin time are recommended in patients taking warfarin, especially at the initiation and termination of androgen therapy. 7.3 Corticosteroids The concurrent use of testosterone with corticosteroids may result in increased fluid retention and requires careful monitoring, particularly in patients with cardiac, renal or hepatic disease. 7.4 Medications that May Also Increase Blood Pressure Some prescription medications and nonprescription analgesic and cold medications contain drugs known to increase blood pressure. Concomitant administration of these medications with XYOSTED may lead to additional increases in blood pressure.
