=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Concomitant use with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor increases exposure to R406 (the major active metabolite).( 7 ) Strong CYP3A4 Inducers: Concomitant use is not recommended. ( 7 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on TAVALISSE Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increases exposure to R406 (the major active metabolite), which may increase the risk of adverse reactions. Monitor for toxicities of TAVALISSE that may require dose reduction (see Table 1 ) when given concurrently with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant use with a strong CYP3A4 inducer reduces exposure to R406. Concomitant use of TAVALISSE with strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Effect of TAVALISSE on Other Drugs CYP3A4 Substrates Concomitant use of TAVALISSE may increase concentrations of some CYP3A4 substrate drugs. Monitor for toxicities of CYP3A4 substrate drug that may require dosage reduction when given concurrently with TAVALISSE [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . BCRP Substrates Concomitant use of TAVALISSE may increase concentrations of BCRP substrate drugs (e.g., rosuvastatin). Monitor for toxicities of BCRP substrate drug that may require dosage reduction when given concurrently with TAVALISSE [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . P-Glycoprotein (P-gp) Substrates Concomitant use of TAVALISSE may increase concentrations of P-gp substrates (e.g., digoxin). Monitor for toxicities of the P-gp substrate drug that may require dosage reduction when given concurrently with TAVALISSE [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .
