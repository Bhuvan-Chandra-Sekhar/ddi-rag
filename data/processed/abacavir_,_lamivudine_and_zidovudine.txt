=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Methadone: An increased methadone dose may be required in a small number of patients. ( 7.1 ) Riociguat: The riociguat dose may need to be reduced. ( 7.1 ) Sorbitol: Coadministration of lamivudine and sorbitol may decrease lamivudine concentrations; when possible, avoid chronic coadministration. ( 7.2 ) Agents antagonistic with zidovudine: Concomitant use should be avoided. ( 7.3 ) Hematologic/bone marrow suppressive/cytotoxic agents: May increase the hematologic toxicity of zidovudine. ( 7.3 ) 7.1 Abacavir Methadone In a trial of 11 HIV-1-infected subjects receiving methadone-maintenance therapy with 600 mg of ZIAGEN ® twice daily (twice the currently recommended dose), oral methadone clearance increased [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )] . This alteration will not result in a methadone dose modification in the majority of patients; however, an increased methadone dose may be required in a small number of patients. Riociguat Coadministration with fixed-dose abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine resulted in increased riociguat exposure, which may increase the risk of riociguat adverse reactions [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. The riociguat dose may need to be reduced. See full prescribing information for ADEMPAS (riociguat). 7.2 Lamivudine Sorbitol Coadministration of single doses of lamivudine and sorbitol resulted in a sorbitol dose-dependent reduction in lamivudine exposures. When possible, avoid use of sorbitol-containing medicines with lamivudine-containing medicines [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )] . 7.3 Zidovudine Agents Antagonistic with Zidovudine Concomitant use of zidovudine with the following drugs should be avoided since an antagonistic relationship has been demonstrated in vitro : Stavudine Doxorubicin Nucleoside analogues, e.g., ribavirin Hematologic/Bone Marrow Suppressive/Cytotoxic Agents Coadministration with the following drugs may increase the hematologic toxicity of zidovudine: Ganciclovir Interferon alfa Ribavirin Other bone marrow suppressive or cytotoxic agents
