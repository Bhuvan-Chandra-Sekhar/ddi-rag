=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A Inhibitors : Reduce JASCAYD dosage to 9 mg twice daily. ( 2.2 , 7.1 ) Moderate or Strong CYP3A Inducers : Avoid concomitant use with JASCAYD. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on JASCAYD Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Reduce the dosage of JASCAYD to 9 mg twice daily when used concomitantly with strong CYP3A inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Nerandomilast is a CYP3A substrate. Concomitant use of JASCAYD with a strong CYP3A inhibitor increases exposure of nerandomilast, which may increase the risk of JASCAYD adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Moderate or Strong CYP3A Inducers Avoid use of JASCAYD with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers. Nerandomilast is a CYP3A substrate. Concomitant use of JASCAYD with moderate or strong CYP3A inducers is expected to decrease exposure of nerandomilast, which may decrease the efficacy of JASCAYD [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Pirfenidone Recommended dosage of JASCAYD is 18 mg twice daily when used concomitantly with pirfenidone. Do not reduce the dosage to 9 mg twice daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Concomitant use of JASCAYD with pirfenidone decreases exposure of nerandomilast [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . When JASCAYD was used concomitantly with pirfenidone in patients with IPF in FIBRONEER-IPF, efficacy was not observed with the JASCAYD 9 mg twice daily dosage [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] .
