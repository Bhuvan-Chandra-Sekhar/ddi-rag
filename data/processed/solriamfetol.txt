7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that Increase Blood Pressure and/or Heart Rate and Dopaminergic Drugs : Use caution when co-administering with SUNOSI. ( 7.2 , 7.3 ) 7.1 Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) Inhibitors Do not administer SUNOSI concomitantly with MAOIs or within 14 days after discontinuing MAOI treatment. Concomitant use of MAO inhibitors and noradrenergic drugs may increase the risk of a hypertensive reaction.

Interactions with dopaminergic drugs have not been evaluated with SUNOSI. Use caution when concomitantly administering dopaminergic drugs with SUNOSI.
