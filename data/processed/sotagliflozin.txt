Drug: sotagliflozin

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Digoxin : Monitor digoxin levels. ( 7.1 ) Uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase Inducers (e.g., rifampin): Sotagliflozin exposure is reduced. Consider monitoring of clinical status. ( 7.2 ) Lithium: Monitor serum lithium concentrations. ( 7.3 ) 7.1 Digoxin There is an increase in the exposure of digoxin when coadministered with INPEFA 400 mg. Patients taking INPEFA with concomitant digoxin should be monitored appropriately [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.2 Uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) Inducer Glucuronidation by UGT1A9, to form the 3-O-glucuronide, was identified as a major metabolic pathway for sotagliflozin. The coadministration of rifampicin, an inducer of UGTs, with a single dose of 400 mg sotagliflozin resulted in a decrease in the exposure to sotagliflozin. This decrease in exposure to sotagliflozin may decrease efficacy [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.3 Lithium Concomitant use of an SGLT2 inhibitor with lithium may decrease serum lithium concentrations. Monitor serum lithium concentration more frequently during INPEFA initiation and dosage changes.
