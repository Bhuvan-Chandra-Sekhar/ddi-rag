Drug: romidepsin

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Carefully monitor prothrombin time (PT) and International Normalized Ratio (INR) in patients concurrently administered romidepsin and warfarin or coumarin derivatives ( 7.1 ). Monitor for toxicities related to increased romidepsin exposure when co- administering romidepsin with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors ( 7.2 ). Avoid use with rifampin and strong CYP3A4 inducers ( 7.3 ). 7.1 Warfarin or Coumarin Derivatives Prolongation of PT and elevation of INR were observed in a patient receiving romidepsin concomitantly with warfarin. Monitor PT and INR more frequently in patients concurrently receiving romidepsin and warfarin [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.2 Drugs That Inhibit CYP3A4 Enzymes Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increase concentrations of romidepsin [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Monitor for toxicity related to increased romidepsin exposure and follow the dose modifications for toxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] when romidepsin is initially co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. 7.3 Drugs That Induce CYP3A4 Enzymes Rifampin (a potent CYP3A4 inducer) increased the concentrations of romidepsin [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Avoid co-administration of romidepsin with rifampin. The use of other potent CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided when possible.
