Drug: 68ga-dotatate

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Somatostatin Analogs : Somatostatin analogs competitively bind to the same somatostatin receptors as gallium Ga 68 dotatate and may affect imaging – image just prior to dosing with long-acting somatostatin analogs. ( 7.1 ) Glucocorticoids : Repeated administration of high doses of glucocorticoids prior to gallium Ga 68 dotatate administration may affect imaging. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Somatostatin analogs Non-radioactive somatostatin analogs competitively bind to the same somatostatin receptors as gallium Ga 68 dotatate. Image patients with gallium Ga 68 dotatate PET just prior to dosing with long-acting analogs of somatostatin. Short-acting analogs of somatostatin can be used up to 24 hours before imaging with gallium Ga 68 dotatate. 7.2 Glucocorticoids Glucocorticoids can down-regulate somatostatin subtype 2 receptors (SSTR2). Repeated administration of high doses of glucocorticoids prior to gallium Ga 68 dotatate administration may result in false negative imaging.
