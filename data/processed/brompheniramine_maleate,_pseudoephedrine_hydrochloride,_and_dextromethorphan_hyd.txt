=== Drug Interactions ===
Drug Interactions: Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) Hyperpyrexia, hypotension, and death have been reported coincident with the coadministration of MAOIs and products containing dextromethorphan. In addition, MAOIs prolong and intensify the anticholinergic (drying) effects of antihistamines and may enhance the effect of pseudoephedrine. Concomitant administration of Brompheniramine Maleate, Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride, and Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide Syrup and MAOIs should be avoided (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Central nervous system (CNS) depressants Antihistamines have additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants (hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, antianxiety agents, etc.). Antihypertensive drugs Sympathomimetic may reduce the effects of antihypertensive drugs.
