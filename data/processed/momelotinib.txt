Drug: momelotinib

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide (OATP)1B1/B3 inhibitors: Monitor for adverse reactions. ( 7.1 ) • Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) substrates: Reduce rosuvastatin (BCRP substrate) dosage. Follow approved product information recommendations for other BCRP substrates. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on OJJAARA Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide (OATP)1B1/B3 Inhibitors Momelotinib is an OATP1B1/B3 substrate. Concomitant use with an OATP1B1/B3 inhibitor increases momelotinib maximal concentrations (C max ) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )], which may increase the risk of adverse reactions with OJJAARA. Monitor patients concomitantly receiving an OATP1B1/B3 inhibitor for adverse reactions and consider OJJAARA dose modifications [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . 7.2 Effect of OJJAARA on Other Drugs Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) Substrates Momelotinib is a BCRP inhibitor. OJJAARA may increase exposure of BCRP substrates , which may increase the risk of BCRP substrate adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . When administered concomitantly with OJJAARA, initiate rosuvastatin (BCRP substrate) at 5 mg and do not increase to more than 10 mg once daily. Dose adjustment of other BCRP substrates may also be needed. Follow approved product information recommendations for other BCRP substrates.
