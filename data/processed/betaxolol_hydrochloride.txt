=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Oral beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitors may have additive effects. (7.1 ) Catecholamine-depleting drugs may have additive effects. ( 7.2 ) Concomitant adrenergic psychotropic drugs may have additive effects. ( 7.3 ) 7.1 Oral Beta-Adrenergic Receptor Inhibitors Patients who are receiving a beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitor orally and BETOPTIC S should be observed for a potential additive effect either on the IOP or on the known systemic effects of beta blockade. 7.2 Catecholamine-Depleting Drugs Close observation of the patient is recommended when a beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitor is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or bradycardia, which may result in vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. 7.3 Concomitant Adrenergic Psychotropic Drugs Betaxolol is an adrenergic receptor inhibitor; therefore, caution should be exercised in patients using concomitant adrenergic psychotropic drugs. 7.4 Calcium Antagonists, Antiarrhythmics and Digitalis The concomitant use of a beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitor with calcium antagonists, antiarrhythmics (including amiodarone) or digitalis may have additive effects resulting in hypotension and/or marked bradycardia.
