=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Interaction with live vaccine indicated for prevention of Zaire ebolavirus infection: No vaccine interaction studies have been performed. EBANGA may reduce the efficacy of the live vaccine. The interval between administration of EBANGA therapy and live vaccination should be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Vaccine Interactions No vaccine-therapeutic interaction studies have been performed in human subjects using EBANGA. However, because of the potential for EBANGA to inhibit replication of a live vaccine virus indicated for prevention of Zaire ebolavirus infection and possibly reduce the efficacy of the vaccine, avoid the concurrent administration of a live vaccine during treatment with EBANGA. The interval between administration of EBANGA therapy and live vaccination should be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines. The efficacy of EBANGA among subjects who reported receipt of a recombinant live vaccine prior to their enrollment in the PALM trial was similar to subjects who did not report receiving a vaccine prior to enrollment.
