Drug: revumenib

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Reduce the REVUFORJ dose. ( 2.2 , 7.1 ) Strong or moderate CYP3A4 Inducers: Avoid concomitant use with REVUFORJ. ( 7.1 ) QTc Prolonging Drugs: Avoid concomitant use with REVUFORJ. If concomitant use is unavoidable, monitor patients more frequently for QTc interval prolongation. ( 5.2 , 7.1 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on REVUFORJ Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors If concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is required, reduce the REVUFORJ dosage [see Recommended Dosage (2.2) ] . Revumenib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Concomitant use with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor increases revumenib systemic exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology(12.3) ] , which may increase the risk of REVUFORJ adverse reactions. Strong or Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers Avoid concomitant use with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers. Revumenib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Concomitant use with a strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducer may decrease revumenib and increase M1 systemic exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , which may reduce REVUFORJ efficacy or increase the risk of QT prolongation associated with the M1 metabolite. Drugs that Prolong QTc Interval Avoid concomitant use of REVUFORJ with other drugs with a known potential to prolong QTc interval. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, obtain ECGs when initiating, during concomitant use, and as clinically indicated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Withhold REVUFORJ if the QTc interval is greater than 480 msec. Restart REVUFORJ after the QTc interval returns to less than or equal to 480 msec [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . REVUFORJ causes QTc interval prolongation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Concomitant use of REVUFORJ with other drugs that prolong QTc interval may result in an increase in the QTc interval and adverse reactions associated with QTc interval prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions(5.2) ].
