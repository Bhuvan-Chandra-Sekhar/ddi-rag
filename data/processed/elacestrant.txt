7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers : Avoid concomitant use with ORSERDU ( 7.1 ) Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors : Avoid concomitant use with ORSERDU ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on ORSERDU Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors Avoid concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors with ORSERDU. Elacestrant is a CYP3A4 substrate. Concomitant use of a strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor increase elacestrant exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may increase the risk of adverse reactions of ORSERDU. Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers Avoid concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A inducers with ORSERDU. Elacestrant is a CYP3A4 substrate. Concomitant use of a strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducer decreases elacestrant exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may decrease effectiveness of ORSERDU. 7.2 Effect of ORSERDU on Other Drugs P-gp Substrates Reduce the dosage of P-gp substrates per their Prescribing Information when minimal concentration changes may lead to serious or life-threatening adverse reactions. Elacestrant is a P-gp inhibitor. Concomitant use of ORSERDU with a P-gp substrate increased the concentrations of P-gp substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may increase the adverse reactions associated with a P-gp substrate. BCRP Substrates Reduce the dosage of BCRP substrates per their Prescribing Information when minimal concentration changes may lead to serious or life-threatening adverse reactions. Elacestrant is a BCRP inhibitor. Concomitant use of ORSERDU with a BCRP substrate increased the plasma concentrations of BCRP substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may increase the adverse reactions associated with a BCRP substrate.
