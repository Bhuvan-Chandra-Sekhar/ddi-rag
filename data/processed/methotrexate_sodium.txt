=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Refer to the full prescribing information for drug interactions with methotrexate. (7) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Methotrexate Drugs that Increase Methotrexate Exposure Coadministration of methotrexate with the following products may increase methotrexate plasma concentrations, which may increase the risk of methotrexate severe adverse reactions. In some cases, the coadministration of methotrexate with these products may also subsequently reduce active metabolite formation, which may decrease the clinical effectiveness of methotrexate. Increased organ specific adverse reactions may also occur when methotrexate is coadministered with hepatotoxic or nephrotoxic products. If coadministration cannot be avoided, monitor closely for methotrexate adverse reactions when coadministered with: Oral antibiotics (including neomycin) Antifolate drugs (e.g., dapsone, pemetrexed, pyrimethamine and sulfonamides) Oral or intravenous penicillin or sulfonamide antibiotics Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs Highly protein-bound drugs (e.g., oral anticoagulants, phenytoin, salicylates, sulfonamides, sulfonylureas, and tetracyclines) Hepatotoxic products Proton pump inhibitors Weak acids (e.g., salicylates) Nephrotoxic products Probenecid Nitrous Oxide Coadministration of methotrexate with nitrous oxide anesthesia potentiates the effect of methotrexate on folate-dependent metabolic pathways, which may increase the risk of severe methotrexate adverse reactions. Avoid nitrous oxide anesthesia in patients receiving methotrexate. Consider alternative therapies in patients who have received prior nitrous oxide anesthesia. Folic Acid Coadministration of methotrexate with folic acid or its derivatives decreases the clinical effectiveness of methotrexate in patients with neoplastic diseases. Methotrexate competes with reduced folates for active transport across cell membranes. Instruct patients to take folic or folinic acid only as directed by their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].
