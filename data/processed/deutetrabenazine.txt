Drug: deutetrabenazine

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of strong CYP2D6 inhibitors: Maximum recommended dose of AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO is 36 mg per day ( 2.3 , 7.1 ) Alcohol or other sedating drugs: May have additive sedation and somnolence ( 7.5 ) 7.1 Strong CYP2D6 Inhibitors A reduction in AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO dose may be necessary when adding a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor in patients maintained on a stable dose of AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO. Concomitant use of strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., paroxetine, fluoxetine, quinidine, bupropion) has been shown to increase the systemic exposure to the active dihydro-metabolites of deutetrabenazine by approximately 3-fold. The daily dose of AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO should not exceed 36 mg per day in patients taking strong CYP2D6 inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.2 Reserpine Reserpine binds irreversibly to VMAT2 and the duration of its effect is several days. Prescribers should wait for chorea or dyskinesia to reemerge before administering AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO to help reduce the risk of overdosage and major depletion of serotonin and norepinephrine in the central nervous system. At least 20 days should elapse after stopping reserpine before starting AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO. AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO should not be used concomitantly with reserpine [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 7.3 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO are contraindicated in patients taking MAOIs. AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO should not be used in combination with an MAOI, or within 14 days of discontinuing therapy with an MAOI [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 7.4 Neuroleptic Drugs The risk of parkinsonism, NMS, and akathisia may be increased by concomitant use of AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO with dopamine antagonists or antipsychotics. 7.5 Alcohol or Other Sedating Drugs Concomitant use of alcohol or other sedating drugs may have additive effects and worsen sedation and somnolence [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )]. 7.6 Concomitant Tetrabenazine or Valbenazine AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO are contraindicated in patients currently taking tetrabenazine or valbenazine. AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO may be initiated the day following discontinuation of tetrabenazine [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )].
