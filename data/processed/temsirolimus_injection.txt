=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong inducers of CYP3A4/5 and inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect concentrations of the primary metabolite of Temsirolimus injection. If alternatives cannot be used, dose modifications of Temsirolimus injection are recommended. (7.1, 7.2,7.3) 7.1 Agents Inducing CYP3A Metabolism Co-administration of Temsirolimus injection with rifampin, a potent CYP3A4/5 inducer, had no significant effect on temsirolimus C max (maximum concentration) and AUC (area under the concentration versus the time curve) after intravenous administration, but decreased sirolimus C max by 65% and AUC by 56% compared to Temsirolimus injection treatment alone. If alternative treatment cannot be administered, a dose adjustment should be considered [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . 7.2 Agents Inhibiting CYP3A Metabolism Co-administration of Temsirolimus injection with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, had no significant effect on temsirolimus C max or AUC; however, sirolimus AUC increased 3.1-fold, and C max increased 2.2-fold compared to Temsirolimus injection alone. If alternative treatment cannot be administered, a dose adjustment should be considered [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . 7.3 Angioedema with ACE inhibitors and Calcium Channel Blokers Angioedema has been reported in patients taking mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors in combination with ramipril and/or amlodipine. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of angioedema when temsirolimus is given concomitantly with an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (e.g., ramipril) or calcium channel blockers (CCB) (e.g., amlodipine).
