=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Beta-blockers, digitalis, and other agents known to impair cardiac contractility and conduction may increase risk for hypotension, bradycardia, and heart failure. ( 7.1 ) • CYP450 3A4: Diltiazem is both a substrate and inhibitor of CYP450 3A4. CYP450 3A4 substrates may require dosage adjustment. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Agents Known to Impair Cardiac Contractility and Conduction Using other agents known to affect cardiac conduction or contractility with diltiazem may increase the risk of bradycardia, AV block, and heart failure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 )]. Ivabradine: Concurrent use of diltiazem increases exposure to ivabradine and may exacerbate bradycardia and conduction disturbances. Avoid concomitant use of ivabradine and diltiazem. 7.2 P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and Cytochrome P450 3A4 Mediated Drug Interactions Diltiazem is both a substrate and an inhibitor of the Pg-p and cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system which may affect exposure to diltiazem and concomitant drugs metabolized by those pathways. Patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment may be particularly at risk of exposure changes [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] .
