Drug: duvelisib

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CYP3A4 inhibitors: Reduce COPIKTRA dose to 15 mg twice daily when co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. ( 2.4 , 7.1 , 12.3 ) Strong CYP3A4 inducers: Avoid coadministration. ( 2.5 , 7.1 , 12.3 ) Moderate CYP3A4 inducers: Avoid coadministration. If coadministration cannot be avoided, increase the dose of COPIKTRA. ( 2.5 , 7.1 , 12.3 ) CYP3A4 substrates: Monitor for signs of toxicities when co-administering COPIKTRA with sensitive CYP3A substrates. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on COPIKTRA Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Coadministration with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor increases duvelisib AUC [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may increase the risk of COPIKTRA toxicities. Reduce COPIKTRA dosage when co-administered with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers Coadministration with a strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducer decreases duvelisib area under the curve (AUC) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may reduce COPIKTRA efficacy. Avoid coadministration of strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers with COPIKTRA. If coadministration with a moderate CYP3A4 inducer cannot be avoided, increase the COPIKTRA dose. [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.2 Effects of COPIKTRA on Other Drugs CYP3A4 Substrates Coadministration with COPIKTRA increases AUC of a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] which may increase the risk of toxicities of these drugs. Consider reducing the dose of the sensitive CYP3A4 substrate and monitor for signs of toxicities of the co-administered sensitive CYP3A4 substrate.
