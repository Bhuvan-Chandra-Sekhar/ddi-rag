Drug: lofexidine

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Methadone : Methadone and lofexidine tablets both prolong the QT interval. ECG monitoring is recommended when used concomitantly. ( 7.1 ) • Oral Naltrexone : Comcomitant use may reduce efficacy of oral naltrexone. ( 7.2 ) • CYP2D6 Inhibitors : Concomitant use of paroxetine resulted in increased plasma levels of lofexidine tablets. Monitor for symptoms of orthostasis and bradycardia with concomitant use of a CYP2D6 inhibitor. ( 7.4 ) 7.1 Methadone Lofexidine tablet and methadone both prolong the QT interval. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients receiving methadone and lofexidine tablet [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.2 Oral Naltrexone Coadministration of lofexidine tablet and oral naltrexone resulted in statistically significant differences in the steady-state pharmacokinetics of naltrexone. It is possible that oral naltrexone efficacy may be reduced if used concomitantly within 2 hours of lofexidine tablet.This interaction is not expected if naltrexone is administered by non-oral routes [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.3 CNS Depressant Drugs Lofexidine tablet potentiates the CNS depressant effects of benzodiazepines and may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of alcohol, barbiturates, and other sedating drugs. Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider of other medications they are taking, including alcohol [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. 7.4 CYP2D6 Inhibitor - Paroxetine Coadministration of lofexidine tablet and paroxetine resulted in 28% increase in the extent of absorption of lofexidine tablet. Monitor for orthostatic hypotension and bradycardia when an inhibitor of CYP2D6 is used concomitantly with lofexidine tablet [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )].
