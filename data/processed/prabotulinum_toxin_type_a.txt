=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No formal drug interaction studies have been conducted with JEUVEAU (prabotulinumtoxinA-xvfs) for injection. However, the potential for certain drugs to potentiate the effects of JEUVEAU warrant consideration given the potential risks involved and should be used with caution. • Aminoglycosides or other agents interfering with neuromuscular transmission • Anticholinergic drugs • Botulinum neurotoxin products • Muscle relaxant Closely observe patients receiving concomitant treatment of JEUVEAU and aminoglycosides or other agents interfering with neuromuscular transmission (e.g., curare-like agents), or muscle relaxants because JEUVEAU’s effect may be potentiated ( 7 )
