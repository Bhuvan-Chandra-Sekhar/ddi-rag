Drug: revefenacin

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Anticholinergics: May interact additively with concomitantly used anticholinergic medications. Avoid administration of YUPELRI with other anticholinergic-containing drugs. ( 7.1 ) • Transporter-related drug interactions: Coadministration of YUPELRI with OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 inhibitors (e.g. rifampicin, cyclosporine, etc.) may lead to an increase in exposure of the active metabolite. Therefore, coadministration with YUPELRI is not recommended. ( 7.2 , 12.3 ) 7.1 Anticholinergics There is potential for an additive interaction with concomitantly used anticholinergic medicines. Therefore, avoid coadministration of YUPELRI with other anticholinergic-containing drugs as this may lead to an increase in anticholinergic adverse effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 )] . 7.2 Transporter-Related Drug Interactions OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 inhibitors (e.g. rifampicin, cyclosporine, etc.) could lead to an increase in systemic exposure of the active metabolite. Therefore, coadministration with YUPELRI is not recommended [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .
Drug Interaction Studies Revefenacin and Cytochrome P450 Neither revefenacin nor its active metabolite inhibits the following cytochrome P450 isoforms: CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5. Neither revefenacin nor its active metabolite induces CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4/5. Revefenacin and Efflux Transporters Revefenacin is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP. Neither revefenacin nor its active metabolite is an inhibitor of these efflux transporters. Revefenacin and Uptake Transporters The active metabolite of revefenacin is a substrate of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Neither revefenacin nor its active metabolite is an inhibitor of the uptake transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, or OCT2.
