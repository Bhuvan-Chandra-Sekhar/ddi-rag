=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Other Biological Products Used to Treat UC and CD The concurrent use of ZYMFENTRA with other immunosuppressive biological products used to treat UC and CD may increase the risk of infection and is not recommended [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 ) ]. Consier the half-life and mode of action of prior biologial products to avoid unintended additive immunosuppressive effects when initiating ZYMFENTRA [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 ) ]. 7.2 Cytochrome P450 Substrates The formation of CYP450 enzymes may be suppressed by increased levels of cytokines (e.g., TNFα, IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, IFN) during chronic inflammation. Therefore, ZYMFENTRA, an antagonist of TNFα, could normalize the formation of CYP450 enzymes potentially resulting in a decrease in exposure of CYP450 substrates. Upon initiation or discontinuation of TNF blockers, including ZYMFENTRA, in patients being treated with CYP450 substrates requiring therapeutic drug monitoring, monitor therpeutic parameters (e.g., INR for warfarin) or drug concentration (e.g., cyclosporine or theophylline). Dosage adjustment may be needed to maintain drug concentrations or parameters within the therapeutic range. See prescribing information for specific drugs. 7.3 Live Vaccines/Therapeutic Infectious Agents It is recommended that live vaccines not be given concurrently with ZYMFENTRA. It is also recommended that live vaccines not be given to infants after in utero exposure to infliximab products for 6 months following birth [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 ) ]. It is recommended that therapeutic infectious agents not be given concurrently with ZYMFENTRA [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 ) ].
