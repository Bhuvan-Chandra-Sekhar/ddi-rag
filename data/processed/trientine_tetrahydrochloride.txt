=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Mineral Supplements (e.g. iron, zinc, calcium, magnesium): Avoid concomitant use. If concomitant use is unavoidable ( 2.2 , 7.1 ): Iron : Take CUVRIOR at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after iron. Other Mineral Supplements : Take CUVRIOR at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after other mineral supplements. Other Drugs for Oral Administration : Take CUVRIOR at least 1 hour apart from any other oral drug. ( 2.2 , 7.1 ) 7.1 Mineral Supplements and Other Oral Drugs CUVRIOR has the potential to chelate non-copper cations in mineral supplements and other oral drugs, and could be rendered ineffective prior to systemic absorption. Mineral Supplements Avoid concomitant use of mineral supplements such as iron, zinc, calcium, or magnesium with CUVRIOR because they may reduce the absorption of CUVRIOR. However, if iron deficiency develops [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ], iron supplementation may be given in short courses, but because iron and CUVRIOR each inhibit absorption of the other, administer CUVRIOR at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after administration of an iron supplement [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. If concomitant use of other mineral supplements is unavoidable, administer CUVRIOR at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after administration of other mineral supplements. Other Drugs for Oral Administration Administer CUVRIOR at least 1 hour apart from any other oral drug.
