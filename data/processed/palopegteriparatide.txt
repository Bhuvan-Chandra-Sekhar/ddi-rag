7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs Known to Affect Calcium : When used concomitantly with YORVIPATH, measure serum calcium levels more frequently. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Drugs Affected by Serum Calcium Digoxin YORVIPATH increases serum calcium, therefore, concomitant use with digoxin (which has a narrow therapeutic index) may predispose patients to digitalis toxicity if hypercalcemia develops. Digoxin efficacy may be reduced if hypocalcemia is present. When YORVIPATH is used concomitantly with digoxin, measure serum calcium and digoxin levels, and monitor for signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity. Adjustment of the digoxin and/or YORVIPATH dose may be needed. 7.2 Drugs Known to Affect Serum Calcium Drugs that affect serum calcium may alter the therapeutic response to YORVIPATH. Measure serum calcium more frequently when YORVIPATH is used concomitantly with these drugs, particularly after these drugs are initiated, discontinued, or dose-adjusted.
