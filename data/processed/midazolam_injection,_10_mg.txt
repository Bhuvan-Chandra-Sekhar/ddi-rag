=== Drug Interactions ===
Effect of Concomitant Use of Benzodiazepines and Opioids The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids increases the risk of respiratory depression because of actions at different receptor sites in the CNS that control respiration. Benzodiazepines interact at GABAA sites and opioids interact primarily at mu receptors. When benzodiazepines and opioids are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression exists. Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation. Other CNS Depressants and Alcohol The sedative effect of Midazolam Injection is accentuated by concomitantly administered medication that depresses the central nervous system, particularly opioids (e.g., morphine, meperidine, and fentanyl), secobarbital, and droperidol, and also by alcohol [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.4, 5.6)]. Cytochrome P450-3A4 Inhibitors Caution is advised when Midazolam Injection is administered concomitantly with drugs that are known to inhibit the P450-3A4 enzyme system (e.g., cimetidine, erythromycin, diltiazem, verapamil, ketoconazole, and itraconazole). These drug interactions may result in prolonged sedation caused by a decrease in plasma clearance of midazolam [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Benzodiazepines and Opioids: Risk of respiratory depression is increased. (7.1) Other CNS Depressants and Alcohol: Sedative effect of midazolam is increased. (7.2) Cytochrome P450-3A4 Inhibitors: May result in prolonged sedation due to decreased plasma clearance of midazolam. (7.3)
