Drug: larotrectinib

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Avoid coadministration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with VITRAKVI. If coadministration cannot be avoided, reduce the VITRAKVI dose. ( 2.5 , 7.1 ) Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Monitor for adverse reactions more frequently in patients coadministered a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor with VITRAKVI and reduce the VITRAKVI dosage based on severity of adverse reactions. ( 7.1 ) Strong CYP3A4 Inducers: Avoid coadministration of strong CYP3A4 inducers with VITRAKVI. If coadministration cannot be avoided, increase the VITRAKVI dose. ( 2.6 , 7.1 ) Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers: Increase the VITRAKVI dose. ( 2.6 , 7.1 ) Sensitive CYP3A4 Substrates: Avoid coadministration of sensitive CYP3A4 substrates with VITRAKVI. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on VITRAKVI Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors Coadministration of VITRAKVI with a strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor may increase larotrectinib plasma concentrations, which may result in a higher incidence of adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Avoid coadministration of VITRAKVI with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, including grapefruit or grapefruit juice. If coadministration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors cannot be avoided, modify VITRAKVI dose as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . In patients coadministered a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor with VITRAKVI, monitor for adverse reactions more frequently and reduce the VITRAKVI dosage based on the severity of emergent adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers Coadministration of VITRAKVI with a strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducer may decrease larotrectinib plasma concentrations, which may decrease the efficacy of VITRAKVI [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Avoid coadministration of VITRAKVI with strong CYP3A4 inducers, including St. John's wort. If coadministration of strong CYP3A4 inducers cannot be avoided, modify VITRAKVI dose as recommended. For coadministration with moderate CYP3A4 inducers, modify VITRAKVI dose as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. 7.2 Effects of VITRAKVI on Other Drugs Sensitive CYP3A4 Substrates Coadministration of VITRAKVI with sensitive CYP3A4 substrates may increase their plasma concentrations, which may increase the incidence or severity of adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Avoid coadministration of VITRAKVI with sensitive CYP3A4 substrates. If coadministration of these sensitive CYP3A4 substrates cannot be avoided, monitor patients for increased adverse reactions of these drugs.
