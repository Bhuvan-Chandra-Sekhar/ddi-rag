7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 5 includes clinically important drug interactions with REMERON/REMERONSolTab [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Table 5: Clinically Important Drug Interactions with REMERON/REMERONSolTab Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Clinical Impact The concomitant use of serotonergic drugs, including REMERON/REMERONSolTab, and MAOIs increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. Intervention REMERON/REMERONSolTab is contraindicated in patients taking MAOIs, including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Examples selegiline, tranylcypromine, isocarboxazid, phenelzine, linezolid, methylene blue Other Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact The concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with REMERON/REMERONSolTab increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. Intervention Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider discontinuation of REMERON/REMERONSolTab and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Examples SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, amphetamines, St. John's Wort, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone Strong CYP3A Inducers Clinical Impact The concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers with REMERON/REMERONSolTab decreases the plasma concentration of mirtazapine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Intervention Increase the dose of REMERON/REMERONSolTab if needed with concomitant CYP3A inducer use. Conversely, a decrease in dosage of REMERON/REMERONSolTab may be needed if the CYP3A inducer is discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Examples phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Clinical Impact The concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors with REMERON/REMERONSolTab may increase the plasma concentration of mirtazapine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Intervention Decrease the dose of REMERON/REMERONSolTab if needed with concomitant strong CYP3A inhibitor use. Conversely, an increase in dosage of REMERON/REMERONSolTab may be needed if the CYP3A inhibitor is discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Examples itraconazole, ritonavir, nefazodone Cimetidine Clinical Impact The concomitant use of cimetidine, a CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A inhibitor, with REMERON/REMERONSolTab may increase the plasma concentration of mirtazapine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Intervention Decrease the dose of REMERON/REMERONSolTab if needed with concomitant cimetidine use. Conversely, an increase in dosage of REMERON/REMERONSolTab may be needed if cimetidine is discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Benzodiazepines and Alcohol Clinical Impact The concomitant use of benzodiazepines or alcohol with REMERON/REMERONSolTab increases the impairment of cognitive and motor skills produced by REMERON/REMERONSolTab alone. Intervention Avoid concomitant use of benzodiazepines and alcohol with REMERON/REMERONSolTab [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Examples diazepam, alprazolam, alcohol Drugs that Prolong QTc Interval Clinical Impact The concomitant use of other drugs which prolong the QTc interval with REMERON/REMERONSolTab, increase the risk of QT prolongation and/or ventricular arrhythmias (e.g., Torsades de Pointes). Intervention Use caution when using REMERON/REMERONSolTab concomitantly with drugs that prolong the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Warfarin Clinical Impact The concomitant use of warfarin with REMERON/REMERONSolTab may result in an increase in INR [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Intervention Monitor INR during concomitant use of warfarin with REMERON/REMERONSolTab. Strong CYP3A inducers: Dosage increase may be needed for REMERON/REMERONSolTab with concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers. ( 2.5 , 7 ) Strong CYP3A inhibitors : Dosage decrease may be needed when REMERON/REMERONSolTab is coadministered with strong CYP3A inhibitors. ( 2.5 , 7 ) Cimetidine: Dosage decrease may be needed when REMERON/REMERONSolTab is coadministered with cimetidine. ( 2.5 , 7 ) Warfarin : Monitor INR during concomitant use. ( 7 )
