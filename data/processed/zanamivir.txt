Drug: zanamivir

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The concurrent use of RELENZA with live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) intranasal has not been evaluated. However, because of potential interference between these products, LAIV should not be administered within 2 weeks before or 48 hours after administration of RELENZA, unless medically indicated. The concern about possible interference arises from the potential for antiviral drugs to inhibit replication of live vaccine virus. Trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine can be administered at any time relative to use of RELENZA [see Microbiology ( 12.4 )] . Live attenuated influenza vaccine, intranasal ( 7 ): • Do not administer until 48 hours following cessation of RELENZA. • Do not administer RELENZA until 2 weeks following administration of the live attenuated influenza vaccine, unless medically indicated.
