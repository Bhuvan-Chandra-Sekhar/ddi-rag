7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Other Oral Drugs : RYBELSUS and OZEMPIC tablets delay gastric emptying. Consider increased clinical or laboratory monitoring when co-administered with other oral medications that have a narrow therapeutic index or that require clinical monitoring. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Concomitant Use with an Insulin Secretagogue (e.g., Sulfonylurea) or with Insulin Semaglutide stimulates insulin release in the presence of elevated blood glucose concentrations. Patients receiving RYBELSUS or OZEMPIC tablets in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia. When initiating RYBELSUS or OZEMPIC tablets, consider reducing the dosage of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogue (such as sulfonylureas) or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 7.2 Other Oral Drugs Semaglutide cause a delay of gastric emptying and thereby has the potential to impact the absorption of other oral drugs. Levothyroxine exposure was increased 33% (90% CI: 1.25 to 1.42) when administered with semaglutide tablets in a drug interaction study [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . When using RYBELSUS or OZEMPIC tablets concomitantly with other oral drugs that have a narrow therapeutic index or that require clinical monitoring, consider increased clinical or laboratory monitoring [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] .
