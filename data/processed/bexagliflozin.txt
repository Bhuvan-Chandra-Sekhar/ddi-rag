Drug: bexagliflozin

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See Table 4 for clinically significant interactions with bexagliflozin tablets. Table 4. Clinically Significant Interactions with Bexagliflozin Tablets UGT Enzyme Inducers Clinical Impact UGT Enzyme Inducers may significantly reduce exposure to bexagliflozin and lead to a decreased efficacy [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Intervention Consider adding another antihyperglycemic agent in patients who require additional glycemic control. Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues Clinical Impact The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when bexagliflozin tablets are used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Intervention A lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with bexagliflozin tablets. Lithium Clinical Impact Concomitant use with SGLT2 inhibitors such as bexagliflozin tablets may decrease serum lithium concentrations. Intervention Monitor serum lithium concentration more frequently upon bexagliflozin tablets initiation and discontinuation. Positive Urine Glucose Test Clinical Impact SGLT2 inhibitors increase urinary glucose excretion and will lead to positive urine glucose tests. Intervention Monitoring glycemic control with urine glucose tests is not recommended in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Use alternative methods to monitor glycemic control. Interference with 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) Assay Clinical Impact Measurements of 1,5-AG are unreliable in assessing glycemic control in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Intervention Monitoring glycemic control with 1,5-AG assay is not recommended. Use alternative methods to monitor glycemic control.
