=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Dimercaprol : Avoid concomitant use. ( 7.2 ) Oral Medications : Separate administration of ACCRUFER from certain oral medications. Monitor clinical responses as appropriate. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on ACCRUFER Oral Medications There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between ACCRUFER and concomitant oral medications. Concomitant use of some drugs may reduce the bioavailability of iron after administration of ACCRUFER. Separate the administration of ACCRUFER from these drugs. The duration of separation may depend on the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as time to peak concentration or whether the drug is an immediate or extended release product. Monitor clinical response to ACCRUFER. 7.2 Effect of ACCRUFER on Other Drugs Dimercaprol Concomitant use of iron products with dimercaprol may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity. Avoid concomitant use of ACCRUFER with dimercaprol. Oral Medications Concomitant use of ACCRUFER may decrease the bioavailability of some drugs, including mycophenolate, ethinyl estradiol, ciprofloxacin and doxycycline [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . For oral drugs where reductions in bioavailability may cause clinically significant effects on its safety or efficacy, separate the administration of ACCRUFER by at least 4 hours. Monitor clinical responses to concomitant drugs as appropriate.
