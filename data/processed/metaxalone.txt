Drug: metaxalone

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Serotonergic Drugs If concomitant use of metaxalone and another serotoneric drug is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage modification. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected or if it occurs. Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) with other serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). 7.2 CNS Depressants If concomitant use of metaxalone and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Due to the additive pharmacologic effect, concomitant use of metaxalone with other CNS depressants may increase the risk of sedation and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 7.3 Interaction of Metaxalone with Benedict’s Tests False-positive Benedict's tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted in metaxalone-treated patients. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings.
