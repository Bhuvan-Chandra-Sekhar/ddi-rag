=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CYP3A4 inducers may decrease Gleevec C max and area under curve (AUC). ( 2.12 , 7.1 , 12.3 ) CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase Gleevec C max and AUC. ( 7.2 , 12.3 ) Gleevec is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 which may increase the C max and AUC of other drugs. ( 7.3 , 7.4 , 12.3 ) Patients who require anticoagulation should receive low-molecular weight or standard heparin and not warfarin. ( 7.3 ) Gleevec may delay the clearance of methotrexate when methotrexate is used at high doses (> 500 mg/m 2 ). ( 7.5 ) 7.1 Agents Inducing CYP3A Metabolism Concomitant administration of Gleevec and strong CYP3A4 inducers may reduce total exposure of imatinib; consider alternative agents [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Agents Inhibiting CYP3A Metabolism Concomitant administration of Gleevec and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors may result in a significant imatinib exposure increase. Grapefruit juice may also increase plasma concentrations of imatinib; avoid grapefruit juice [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 7.3 Interactions With Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A4 Gleevec will increase plasma concentration of CYP3A4 metabolized drugs (e.g., triazolo-benzodiazepines, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, certain HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, etc.). Use caution when administering Gleevec with CYP3A4 substrates that have a narrow therapeutic window. Because warfarin is metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, use low-molecular weight or standard heparin instead of warfarin in patients who require anticoagulation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 7.4 Interactions With Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 Use caution when administering Gleevec with CYP2D6 substrates that have a narrow therapeutic window. 7.5 Interactions With Methotrexate Gleevec may delay the clearance of methotrexate and result in sustained methotrexate concentrations when methotrexate is used at high doses (> 500 mg/m 2 ). Refer to the prescribing information for methotrexate injection for recommendations on management of methotrexate concentrations.
