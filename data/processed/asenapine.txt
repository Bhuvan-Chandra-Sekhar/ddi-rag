=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Antihypertensive drugs: SECUADO may enhance antihypertensive effects. Monitor blood pressure and adjust dosage of antihypertensive drug accordingly. ( 7.1 ) Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors: Consider dose reduction for SECUADO based on clinical response. ( 7.1 ) Paroxetine (CYP2D6 substrate and inhibitor): Reduce paroxetine dose by half. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Drugs Having Clinically Important Drug Interactions with SECUADO Table 6: Clinically Important Drug Interactions with SECUADO Antihypertensive Drugs Clinical Implication Because of its α 1 -adrenergic antagonism with potential for inducing hypotension, SECUADO may enhance the effects of certain antihypertensive agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Prevention or Management: Monitor blood pressure and adjust dosage of antihypertensive drug accordingly. Examples: Diuretics, ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Beta-Blockers, Alpha-blockers Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors Clinical Implication Asenapine is metabolized by CYP1A2. Concomitant use of SECUADO with a CYP1A2 inhibitor increases AUC and C max of asenapine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Prevention or Management: Dosage reduction for SECUADO based on clinical response may be necessary. Examples: Fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin CYP2D6 substrates and inhibitors Clinical Implication Asenapine may enhance the inhibitory effects of paroxetine on its own metabolism by CYP2D6. Concomitant use of SECUADO with paroxetine increases paroxetine AUC and C max [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Prevention or Management: Reduce paroxetine dose by half when paroxetine is used in combination with SECUADO. Examples: Paroxetine
