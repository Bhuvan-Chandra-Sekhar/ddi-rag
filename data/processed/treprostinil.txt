Drug: treprostinil

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Treprostinil dosage adjustment may be necessary if inhibitors or inducers of CYP2C8 are added or withdrawn. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Effect of CYP2C8 Inhibitors and Inducers on Treprostinil Dose adjustment of treprostinil may be necessary when coadministered with CYP2C8 inducers or inhibitors. Human pharmacokinetic studies with an oral formulation of treprostinil (treprostinil diolamine) indicated that coadministration of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 enzyme inhibitor gemfibrozil increases exposure (both C max and AUC) to treprostinil. Coadministration of the CYP2C8 enzyme inducer rifampin decreases exposure to treprostinil. It has not been determined if the changes in exposure of treprostinil with inhibitors or inducers of CYP2C8 observed for the oral administration of treprostinil would be similar for treprostinil administered via the parenteral route [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )].
