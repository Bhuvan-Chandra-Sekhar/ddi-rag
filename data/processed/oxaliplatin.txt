=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Drugs that Prolong the QT Interval QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias can occur with oxaliplatin [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . Avoid coadministration of oxaliplatin with medicinal products with a known potential to prolong the QT interval. 7.2 Use with Nephrotoxic Products Because platinum-containing species are eliminated primarily through the kidney, clearance of these products may be decreased by coadministration of potentially nephrotoxic compounds [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Avoid coadministration of oxaliplatin with medicinal products known to cause nephrotoxicity. 7.3 Use with Anticoagulants Prolonged prothrombin time and INR occasionally associated with hemorrhage have been reported in patients who received oxaliplatin with fluorouracil/leucovorin while on anticoagulants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] .
