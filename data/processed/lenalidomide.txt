Drug: lenalidomide

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Digoxin: Monitor digoxin plasma levels periodically due to increased Cmax and AUC with concomitant lenalidomide capsules therapy ( 7.1 ). Concomitant use of erythropoietin stimulating agents or estrogen containing therapies with lenalidomide capsules may increase the risk of thrombosis ( 7.2 ). 7.1 Digoxin When digoxin was co-administered with multiple doses of lenalidomide (10 mg/day) the digoxin C max and AUC inf were increased by 14%. Periodically monitor digoxin plasma levels, in accordance with clinical judgment and based on standard clinical practice in patients receiving this medication, during administration of lenalidomide capsules. 7.2 Concomitant Therapies That May Increase the Risk of Thrombosis Erythropoietic agents, or other agents that may increase the risk of thrombosis, such as estrogen containing therapies, should be used with caution after making a benefit-risk assessment in patients receiving lenalidomide capsules [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . 7.3 Warfarin Co-administration of multiple doses of lenalidomide (10 mg/day) with a single dose of warfarin (25 mg) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide or R- and S-warfarin. Expected changes in laboratory assessments of PT and INR were observed after warfarin administration, but these changes were not affected by concomitant lenalidomide administration. It is not known whether there is an interaction between dexamethasone and warfarin. Close monitoring of PT and INR is recommended in patients with MM taking concomitant warfarin.
