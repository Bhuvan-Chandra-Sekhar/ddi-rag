=== Drug Interactions ===
7 Drug Interactions 7.1 Drug Effects on Plasma Cortisol Levels Accuracy of the test results can be affected by concomitant medications. Plasma cortisol levels and subsequent diagnosis of adrenocortical insufficiency following CORTROSYN administration may be inaccurate if patients are on certain medications because of their effect on cortisol or cortisol binding globulin levels [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Glucocorticoids and spironolactone: May falsely elevate plasma cortisol levels. Stop these drugs on the day of CORTROSYN testing. Long-acting glucocorticoids may need to be stopped for a longer period before CORTROSYN testing. Estrogen: May elevate plasma total cortisol levels. Stop estrogen containing drugs 4 to 6 weeks before CORTROSYN testing to allow cortisol binding globulin levels to return to levels within the reference range. Alternatively, concomitant measurement of cortisol binding globulin at the time of testing can be done; if cortisol binding globulin levels are elevated, plasma total cortisol levels are considered inaccurate. Drug effects on plasma cortisol levels: ◦ Accuracy of the test results can be affected by concomitant medications.◦ Glucocorticoids and spironolactone: May falsely elevate plasma cortisol levels. Stop these drugs on day of CORTROSYN testing. Long-acting glucocorticoids may need to be stopped for a longer period before CORTROSYN testing. (7)◦ Estrogen: May elevate plasma total cortisol levels. Stop estrogen containing drugs 4 to 6 weeks before CORTROSYN testing. (7) See 17 for PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Revised 12/2023
