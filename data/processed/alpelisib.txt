Drug: alpelisib

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CYP3A4 Inducers : Avoid coadministration of PIQRAY with a strong CYP3A4 inducer. Consider an alternative concomitant drug with no or minimal potential to induce CYP3A4. ( 7.1 ) Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) Inhibitors : Avoid the use of BCRP inhibitors in patients treated with PIQRAY. If unable to use alternative drugs, closely monitor for increased adverse reactions. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on PIQRAY CYP3A4 Inducer Coadministration of PIQRAY with a strong CYP3A4 inducer decreases alpelisib concentration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] , which may reduce alpelisib efficacy. Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers and consider an alternative concomitant drug with no or minimal potential to induce CYP3A4. Breast Cancer Resistance Protein Inhibitors Coadministration of PIQRAY with a breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) inhibitor may increase alpelisib concentration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] , which may increase the risk of toxicities. Avoid the use of BCRP inhibitors in patients treated with PIQRAY. If unable to use alternative drugs, when PIQRAY is used in combination with BCRP inhibitors, closely monitor for increased adverse reactions.
