Drug: lexiscan(r)_(regadenoson)

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No formal pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies have been conducted with LEXISCAN. 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on LEXISCAN • Methylxanthines (e.g., caffeine, aminophylline and theophylline) are non-specific adenosine receptor antagonists that interfere with the vasodilation activity of LEXISCAN [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12- 12.2) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]. Patients should avoid consumption of any products containing methylxanthines as well as any drugs containing theophylline or aminophylline for at least 12 hours before LEXISCAN administration. Aminophylline may be used to attenuate severe or persistent adverse reactions to LEXISCAN [see Overdosage ( 10 )]. • In clinical studies, LEXISCAN was administered to patients taking other cardioactive drugs (i.e., β-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, nitrates, cardiac glycosides, and angiotensin receptor blockers) without reported adverse reactions or apparent effects on efficacy. • Dipyridamole may change the effects of LEXISCAN. When possible, withhold dipyridamole for at least two days prior to LEXISCAN administration. 7.2 Effect of LEXISCAN on Other Drugs Regadenoson does not inhibit the metabolism of substrates for CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes, indicating that it is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolized by these cytochrome P450 enzymes.
