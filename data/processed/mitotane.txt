7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Spironolactone: Avoid concomitant use with LYSODREN. ( 7.1 ) Certain CYP3A Substrates: Avoid concomitant use with LYSODREN. ( 7.2 ) Hormonal contraceptives: Avoid concomitant use with LYSODREN. ( 7.2 ) Warfarin: Avoid concomitant use with LYSODREN. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on LYSODREN Spironolactone Spironolactone may block the action of mitotane. Avoid concomitant use of mitotane with spironolactone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Effects of LYSODREN on Other Drugs Certain CYP3A substrates Mitotane is a strong CYP3A inducer. Concomitant use of LYSODREN may decrease the levels of CYP3A substrates, which may reduce the activity of these substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Avoid concomitant use of LYSODREN with other CYP3A substrates, where minimal level changes may lead to serious therapeutic failures. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, modify the dosage of the CYP3A substrate in accordance with the approved product labeling. Hormonal Contraceptives Avoid concomitant use of LYSODREN with hormonal contraceptives [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) , Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ]. Warfarin Mitotane may induce the metabolism of warfarin, which may reduce its level and its efficacy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Avoid concomitant use of LYSODREN with warfarin. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, monitor INR more frequently and adjust warfarin dose as recommended in accordance with the recommendations in the warfarin Prescribing Information.
