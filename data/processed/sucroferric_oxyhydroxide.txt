7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 1 Oral drugs that can be administered concomitantly with Velphoro Calcitriol Ciprofloxacin Digoxin Enalapril Furosemide HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors Hydrochlorothiazide Losartan Metoprolol Nifedipine Omeprazole Quinidine Warfarin Oral drugs that are to be separated from Velphoro Dosing Recommendations Doxycycline Acetylsalicylic acid Cephalexin Take at least 1 hour before Velphoro. Levothyroxine Take at least 4 hours before Velphoro Velphoro can be administered concomitantly with oral calcitriol, ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, furosemide, HMG‑CoA reductase inhibitors, hydrochlorothiazide, losartan, metoprolol, nifedipine, omeprazole, quinidine and warfarin. ( 7 ) Take acetylsalicylic acid, cephalexin and doxycycline at least 1 hour before Velphoro. ( 7 ) Take levothyroxine at least 4 hours before Velphoro. ( 7 ) For oral medications not listed above where a reduction of bioavailability would be clinically significant consider separation of the timing of administration. Consider monitoring clinical responses or blood levels of the concomitant medication ( 7 ) Oral medications not listed in Table 1 There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between Velphoro and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medications where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy, consider separating the administration of the two drugs. The necessary separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate-release or an extended-release product. Where possible, consider monitoring for clinical response and/or blood levels of concomitant medications that have a narrow therapeutic range.
