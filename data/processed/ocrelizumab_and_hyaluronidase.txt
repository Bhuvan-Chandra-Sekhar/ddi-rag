7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Immunosuppressive or Immune-Modulating Therapies The concomitant use of OCREVUS ZUNOVO and other immune-modulating or immunosuppressive therapies, including immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids, is expected to increase the risk of immunosuppression. Consider the risk of additive immune system effects when coadministering immunosuppressive therapies with OCREVUS ZUNOVO. When switching from drugs with prolonged immune effects, such as daclizumab, fingolimod, natalizumab, teriflunomide, or mitoxantrone, consider the duration and mode of action of these drugs because of additive immunosuppressive effects when initiating OCREVUS ZUNOVO [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 7.2 Vaccinations A Phase 3b randomized, open-label study examined the concomitant use of intravenous ocrelizumab and several non-live vaccines in adults 18-55 years of age with relapsing forms of MS (68 subjects undergoing treatment with intravenous ocrelizumab at the time of vaccination and 34 subjects not undergoing treatment with intravenous ocrelizumab at the time of vaccination). Concomitant exposure to intravenous ocrelizumab attenuated antibody responses to tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine, pneumococcal polysaccharide, pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, and seasonal inactivated influenza vaccines. The impact of the observed attenuation on vaccine effectiveness in this patient population is unknown. The safety and effectiveness of live or live-attenuated vaccines administered concomitantly with ocrelizumab have not been assessed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ].
