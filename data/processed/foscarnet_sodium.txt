=== Drug Interactions ===
Drug Interactions A possible drug interaction of FOSCARNET and intravenous pentamidine has been described. Concomitant treatment of four patients in the United Kingdom with FOSCARNET and intravenous pentamidine may have caused hypocalcemia; one patient died with severe hypocalcemia. Toxicity associated with concomitant use of aerosolized pentamidine has not been reported. Because foscarnet can reduce serum levels of ionized calcium, extreme caution is advised when used concurrently with other drugs known to influence serum calcium levels (e.g., intravenous pentamidine). Renal impairment and symptomatic hypocalcemia have been observed during concurrent treatment with foscarnet and intravenous pentamidine. Because of foscarnet's tendency to cause renal impairment, the use of foscarnet should be avoided in combination with potentially nephrotoxic drugs such as aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, cyclosporine, acyclovir, methotrexate, tacrolimus and intravenous pentamidine (see above) unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the patient. When diuretics are indicated, thiazides are recommended over loop diuretics because the latter inhibit renal tubular secretion, and may impair elimination of foscarnet, potentially leading to toxicity. Abnormal renal function has been observed in clinical practice during the use of foscarnet and ritonavir, or foscarnet, ritonavir, and saquinavir. (See DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION .) Because of the risk of QT prolongation and the potential for torsades de pointes, the use of foscarnet should be avoided in combination with agents known to prolong the QT interval including Class IA (e.g., quinidine or procainamide) or Class III (e.g., dofetilide, amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents, phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, and certain macrolides and fluoroquinolones.
