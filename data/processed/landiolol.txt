7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Negative Inotropes and Chronotropes: Avoid ( 7.1 ) Sympathomimetics, Positive Inotropes and Vasoconstrictors: Avoid ( 7.2 ) Catecholamine Depleting Drugs: Monitor blood pressure and heart rate ( 7.3 ). 7.1 Negative Inotropes and Chronotropes Avoid concomitant use of RAPIBLYK with negative inotropes and medications that slow heart rate or cardiac conduction. Beta-blockers, like RAPIBLYK, can cause depression of myocardial contractility and increase the risk of bradycardia or heart block. Concomitant use of RAPIBLYK with negative inotropes or chronotropes may augment these effects [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )( 5.3 )] . 7.2 Sympathomimetics, Positive Inotropes and Vasoconstrictors Beta adrenergic agonists will antagonize the effects of RAPIBLYK and may attenuate the heart rate lowering effects of RAPIBLYK. Positive inotropes and vasoconstrictors may attenuate the heart rate and blood pressure lowering effects of RAPIBLYK. 7.3 Catecholamine Depleting Drugs Observe patients treated with RAPIBLYK plus a catecholamine depletor (e.g., reserpine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors) for hypotension or marked bradycardia, which may cause vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. Catecholamine depleting drugs may have an additive effect when given with beta-blockers, which may increase the risk of hypotension or marked bradycardia related vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] .
