7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 2: Oral drugs that can be administered concomitantly with Auryxia Amlodipine Aspirin Atorvastatin Calcitriol Clopidogrel Digoxin Diltiazem Doxercalciferol Enalapril Fluvastatin Glimepiride Levofloxacin Losartan Metoprolol Pravastatin Propranolol Sitagliptin Warfarin Oral drugs that have to be separated from Auryxia and meals Dosing Recommendations Doxycycline Take at least 1 hour before Auryxia Ciprofloxacin Take at least 2 hours before or after Auryxia Oral medications not listed in Table 2 There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between Auryxia and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medications where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy, consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs. The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate release or an extended release product. Consider monitoring clinical responses or blood levels of concomitant medications that have a narrow therapeutic range. When clinically significant drug interactions are expected, consider separation of the timing of administration. Consider monitoring clinical responses or blood levels of the concomitant medication.
