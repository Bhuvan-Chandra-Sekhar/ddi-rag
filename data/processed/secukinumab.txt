=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Certain CYP450 Substrates Increased concentrations of cytokines (e.g., IL-17) during chronic inflammation associated with certain diseases including PsO, PsA, AS, nr-axSpA, ERA, and HS may suppress the formation of CYP enzymes. Upon initiation or discontinuation of COSENTYX in patients who are receiving concomitant CYP450 substrates, particularly those where minimal decreases in the concentration may reduce CYP substrate effectiveness or minimal increases in the concentration may increase CYP substrate adverse reactions, consider monitoring for therapeutic effect or concentration of the CYP substrate and consider dosage adjustment of the CYP substrate as needed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .
