Drug: tesamorelin

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Cytochrome P450-metabolized drugs : Monitor patients for potential interactions when administering with EGRIFTA SV . ( 7.1 ) Glucocorticoids : Patients receiving glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in maintenance or stress doses following initiation of EGRIFTA SV. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Cytochrome P450-Metabolized Drugs Co-administration of tesamorelin with simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate had no significant impact on the pharmacokinetics profiles of simvastatin in healthy subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . EGRIFTA SV stimulates GH production. Published data indicate that GH may modulate cytochrome P450 (CYP450) mediated antipyrine clearance. These data suggest that GH may alter the clearance of compounds known to be metabolized by CYP450 liver enzymes (e.g., corticosteroids, sex steroids, anticonvulsants, and cyclosporine). Monitor patients for potential interactions when administering EGRIFTA SV in combination with other drugs known to be metabolized by CYP450 liver enzymes. 7.2 Glucocorticoids GH inhibits 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11βHSD-1), a microsomal enzyme required for conversion of cortisone to its active metabolite, cortisol, in hepatic and adipose tissue. EGRIFTA SV stimulates GH production; therefore, patients receiving glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in maintenance or stress doses following initiation of EGRIFTA SV. Patients treated with cortisone acetate and prednisone may be affected more than others because conversion of these drugs to their biologically active metabolites is dependent on the activity of 11βHSD-1.
