=== Drug Interactions ===
DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Hyporesponse with Anticholinergics The concomitant use anticholinergic drugs may cause a hyporesponse to stimulation testing with ChiRhoStim ® . Discontinue anticholinergic drugs at least 5 half-lives before administering ChiRhoStim ® [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . 7.2 Hyperresponse of Gastrin Secretion with H 2 -Receptor Antagonists and PPIs The concomitant use of H 2 -receptor antagonists or PPIs may cause a hyperresponse in gastrin secretion in response to stimulation testing with ChiRhoStim ® , falsely suggesting gastrinoma. Discontinue H 2 -receptor antagonists at least 2 days before administering ChiRhoStim ® to aid in the diagnosis of gastrinoma. The time it takes for serum gastrin concentrations to return to baseline following discontinuation of PPIs is specific to the individual drug. Consult the prescribing information of each specific PPI before administering ChiRhoStim ® to aid in the diagnosis of gastrinoma.
