7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that increase risk of fluid and electrolyte imbalance ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Drugs That May Increase Risks of Fluid and Electrolyte Abnormalities Use caution when prescribing SUTAB to patients taking medications that increase the risk of fluid and electrolyte disturbances or may increase the risk of adverse events of seizure, arrhythmias, and prolonged QT in the setting of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4 )] . 7.2 Potential for Reduced Drug Absorption SUTAB can reduce the absorption of other co-administered drugs [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] : Administer oral medications at least one hour before starting each dose of SUTAB. Administer tetracycline and fluoroquinolone antibiotics, iron, digoxin, chlorpromazine, and penicillamine at least 2 hours before and not less than 6 hours after administration of each dose of SUTAB to avoid chelation with magnesium. 7.3 Stimulant Laxatives Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and SUTAB may increase the risk of mucosal ulceration or ischemic colitis. Avoid use of stimulant laxatives (e.g., bisacodyl, sodium picosulfate) while taking SUTAB [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] .
