7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Breakthrough Bleeding Treatment: While treatment with all bypassing agents (e.g., rFVIIa or aPCC) can be used for breakthrough bleeds, high and/or frequent doses of FVIII, FIX, or bypassing agents with Alhemo increases the risk of thromboembolism. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Breakthrough Bleeding Treatment Take appropriate precautions when treating breakthrough bleeding events in hemophilia patients receiving Alhemo prophylaxis and FVIII or FIX or a bypassing agent [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . For mild and moderate bleeds that require additional treatment with FVIII or FIX or bypassing agents (e.g., rFVIIa or aPCC), the lowest-approved dose in the approved product labeling is recommended. For aPCC, a maximum dose of 100 units/kg body weight within 24 hours is recommended. For severe bleeds, follow the dosing instructions provided in the approved labeling for the specific product based on clinical judgement. Additive and sometimes synergistic increase in thrombin peak as quantified in the thrombin generation assay has been observed in plasma from hemophilia patients who were on prophylactic treatment with concizumab-mtci with concomitant presence of rFVIII, rFIX or bypassing agents including rFVIIa and aPCC [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] .
