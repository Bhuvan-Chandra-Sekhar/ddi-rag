Drug: lumateperone

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CYP3A4 inducers: Avoid concomitant use with CAPLYTA. ( 7.1 ) Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors: Recommended dosage is 10.5 mg once daily. ( 2.2 , 7.1 ) Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors: Recommended dosage is 21 mg once daily. ( 2.2 , 7.1 ) 7.1 Drugs Having Clinically Important Interactions with CAPLYTA Clinically important drug interactions with CAPLYTA are presented in Table 6. Table 6: Clinically Important Drug Interactions with CAPLYTA CYP3A4 Inducers* Prevention or Management Avoid concomitant use of CAPLYTA with CYP3A4 inducers . Clinical Impact Concomitant use of CAPLYTA with CYP3A4 inducers decreases the exposure of lumateperone [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Moderate or Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors* Prevention or Management Reduce the CAPLYTA dosage when used concomitantly with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ]. Clinical Impact Concomitant use of CAPLYTA with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increases lumateperone exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] , which may increase the risk of adverse reactions. S erotonin Reuptake Inhibitors Prevention or Management Increased monitoring for SRI- associated adverse reactions is recommended. Clinical Impact Although no clinically significant drug interactions with adjunctive SSRI/SNRIs in MDD were observed in CAPLYTA clinical trials, CAPLYTA’s moderate serotonin transporter (SERT) activity may increase the risk of SRI-associated adverse reactions (e.g., serotonin syndrome, hyponatremia). * See www.fda.gov/CYPandTransporterInteractingDrugs for examples of CYP3A4 Inducers and Moderate or Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors
