Drug: eslicarbazepine_acetate

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Carbamazepine: May need dose adjustment for APTIOM or carbamazepine. ( 2.3 , 5.6 , 7.1 ) Phenytoin: Higher dosage of APTIOM may be necessary and dose adjustment may be needed for phenytoin. ( 2.3 , 7.1 , 7.2 ) Phenobarbital or Primidone: Higher dosage of APTIOM may be necessary. ( 2.3 , 7.1 ) Hormonal Contraceptives: APTIOM may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. ( 7.4 , 8.3 ) 7.1 Other Antiepileptic Drugs Several AEDs (e.g., carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and primidone) can induce enzymes that metabolize APTIOM and can cause decreased plasma concentrations of eslicarbazepine [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Higher doses of Aptiom may be needed [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. 7.2 CYP2C19 Substrates APTIOM can inhibit CYP2C19, which can cause increased plasma concentrations of drugs that are metabolized by this isoenzyme (e.g., phenytoin, clobazam, and omeprazole) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Dose adjustment may be needed. 7.3 CYP3A4 Substrates In vivo studies suggest that APTIOM can induce CYP3A4, decreasing plasma concentrations of drugs that are metabolized by this isoenzyme (e.g., simvastatin, lovastatin) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Dose adjustment of simvastatin and lovastatin may be needed if a clinically significant change in lipids is noted. 7.4 Oral Contraceptives Because concomitant use of APTIOM and ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel is associated with lower plasma levels of these hormones, females of reproductive potential should use additional or alternative non-hormonal birth control.
