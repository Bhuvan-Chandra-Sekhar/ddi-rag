7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Drug-Drug Interactions Metformin In patients with renal impairment, metformin can cause lactic acidosis. Iodinated contrast agents appear to increase the risk of metformin induced lactic acidosis, possibly as a result of worsening renal function. Stop metformin at the time of, or prior to, OPTIRAY administration in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast agents. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and reinstitute only after renal function is stable. Radioactive Iodine Administration of iodinated contrast agents may interfere with thyroid uptake of radioactive iodine (I 131) and decrease therapeutic efficacy in patients with carcinoma of the thyroid. The decrease in efficacy lasts for 6-8 weeks. Oral Cholecystographic Contrast Agents Renal toxicity has been reported in patients with liver impairment who were given oral cholecystographic agents followed by intravascular contrast agents. Administration of OPTIRAY should be postponed in patients who have recently received a cholecystographic contrast agent. 7.2 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Protein-Bound Iodine, Radioactive Iodine Determinations The results of protein bound iodine and radioactive iodine uptake studies, which depend on iodine estimation, will not accurately reflect thyroid function for up to 16 days following administration of iodinated contrast agent. However, thyroid function tests that do not depend on iodine estimations, e.g., T3 resin uptake and total or free thyroxine (T4) assays are not affected.
