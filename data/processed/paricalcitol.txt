Drug: paricalcitol

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 6 shows the clinically significant drug interactions with paricalcitol capsules. Table 6: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Paricalcitol CYP3A Inhibitors Clinical Impact Paricalcitol is partially metabolized by CYP3A. Hence, exposure of paricalcitol will increase upon co-administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors such as but not limited to: boceprevir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, grapefruit juice, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, mibefradil, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, voriconazole. Intervention Dose adjustment of paricalcitol capsules may be necessary. Monitor closely for iPTH and serum calcium concentrations, if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. Cholestyramine Clinical Impact Drugs that impair intestinal absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, such as cholestyramine, may interfere with the absorption of paricalcitol. Intervention Recommend to take paricalcitol capsules at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after taking cholestyramine (or at as great an interval as possible) to avoid impeding absorption of paricalcitol. Mineral Oil Clinical Impact Mineral oil or other substances that may affect absorption of fat may influence the absorption of paricalcitol. Intervention Recommend to take paricalcitol capsules at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after taking mineral oil (or at as great an interval as possible) to avoid affecting absorption of paricalcitol. • Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole) will increase the exposure of paricalcitol. Use with caution ( 7 ). • Cholestyramine, Mineral Oil: Intestinal absorption of paricalcitol may be reduced if administered simultaneously with cholestyramine or mineral oil. Take paricalcitol capsules at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after taking cholestyramine or mineral oil ( 7 ).
