=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 7 includes drugs with clinically significant drug interactions when concomitantly used with XELJANZ (tablets and oral solution) and XELJANZ XR (extended-release tablets) and instructions for preventing or managing them. Table 7: Clinically Significant Interactions Affecting XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR When Concomitantly Used with Other Drugs Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) Clinical Impact Increased exposure to tofacitinib Intervention Dosage modification of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Clinical Pharmacology, Figure 3 (12.3) ] Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitantly Used with Strong CYP2C19 Inhibitors (e.g., fluconazole) Clinical Impact Increased exposure to tofacitinib Intervention Dosage modification of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Clinical Pharmacology, Figure 3 (12.3) ] Strong CYP3A4 Inducers (e.g., rifampin) Clinical Impact Decreased exposure to tofacitinib and may result in loss of or reduced clinical response Intervention Concomitant use with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is not recommended [see Clinical Pharmacology, Figure 3 (12.3) ] Immunosuppressive Drugs (e.g., azathioprine, tacrolimus, cyclosporine) Clinical Impact Risk of added immunosuppression; concomitant use of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR with biologic DMARDs or potent immunosuppressants has not been studied in patients with RA, PsA, AS, UC, or pcJIA. Intervention Concomitant use with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is not recommended [see Indications and Usage (1) , Clinical Pharmacology, Figure 3 (12.3) ] See FPI for clinically significant drug interactions.
