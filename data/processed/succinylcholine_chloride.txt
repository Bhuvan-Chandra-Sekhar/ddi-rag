7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that May Enhance the Neuromuscular Blocking Action of Succinylcholine : promazine, oxytocin, aprotinin, certain non-penicillin antibiotics, quinidine, β-adrenergic blockers, procainamide, lidocaine, trimethaphan, lithium carbonate, magnesium salts, quinine, chloroquine, isoflurane, desflurane, metoclopramide, terbutaline, and drugs that reduce plasma cholinesterase activity. (7.1) 7.1 Drugs that May Affect the Neuromuscular Blocking Action of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection Drugs that may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of succinylcholine include: promazine, oxytocin, aprotinin, certain non-penicillin antibiotics, quinidine, β-adrenergic blockers, procainamide, lidocaine, trimethaphan, lithium carbonate, magnesium salts, quinine, chloroquine, isoflurane, desflurane, metoclopramide, and terbutaline. The neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine may be enhanced by drugs that reduce plasma cholinesterase activity (e.g., chronically administered oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors) or by drugs that irreversibly inhibit plasma cholinesterase [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. If other neuromuscular blocking agents are to be used during the same procedure, consider the possibility of a synergistic or antagonistic effect
