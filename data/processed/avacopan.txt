Drug: avacopan

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong and moderate CYP3A4 enzyme inducers: Avoid use. ( 7.1 ) Strong CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitors: Reduce avacopan dose to 30 mg once daily. ( 7.2 ) CYP3A4 substrates: Consider dose reduction of CYP3A4 substrates when co-administering TAVNEOS with CYP3A4 substrates. ( 7.3 ) 7.1 CYP3A4 Inducers Avacopan exposure is decreased when co-administered with strong CYP3A4 enzyme inducers such as rifampin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Avoid coadministration of strong and moderate CYP3A4 inducers with TAVNEOS. 7.2 CYP3A4 Inhibitors Avacopan exposure is increased when co-administered with strong CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitors such as itraconazole [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Administer TAVNEOS 30 mg once daily when coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. 7.3 CYP3A4 Substrates Avacopan is a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor. Co-administration of avacopan and 40 mg simvastatin increases the systemic exposure of simvastatin. While taking TAVNEOS, limit simvastatin dosage to 10 mg daily (or 20 mg daily for patients who have previously tolerated simvastatin 80 mg daily for at least one year without evidence of muscle toxicity). Consider dose reduction of CYP3A4 substrates when co-administering TAVNEOS with CYP3A4 substrates. Consult the concomitant CYP3A4 substrate product information when considering administration of such products together with TAVNEOS [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .
