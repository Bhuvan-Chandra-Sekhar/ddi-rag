=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Coumarin and coumarin derivatives, including warfarin: Anticoagulant activity may be counteracted; monitor laboratory parameters. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Ceftriaxone Precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium can occur when ceftriaxone is mixed with calcium-containing parenteral nutrition solutions, such as KABIVEN, in the same intravenous administration line. Do not administer ceftriaxone simultaneously with KABIVEN via a Y-site. However, ceftriaxone and KABIVEN may be administered sequentially if the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. Deaths have occurred in neonates (28 days of age or younger) who received concomitant intravenous calcium-containing solutions with ceftriaxone resulting from calcium-ceftriaxone precipitates in the lungs and kidneys, even when separate infusion lines were used [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. 7.2 Coumarin and Coumarin Derivatives The soybean oil present in KABIVEN has vitamin K 1 . Vitamin K 1 can reverse the anticoagulant activity of coumarin and coumarin derivatives, including warfarin, which work by blocking recycling of vitamin K 1 . Monitor laboratory parameters for anticoagulant activity in patients who are on both KABIVEN and coumarin or coumarin derivatives.
