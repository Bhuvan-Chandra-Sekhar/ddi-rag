Drug: elinzanetant

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors and grapefruit (juice): Avoid concomitant use with LYNKUET. ( 7.1 ) Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Reduce LYNKUET dosage to 60 mg once daily. ( 2.2 , 7.1 ) Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers: Avoid concomitant use with LYNKUET. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on LYNKUET Elinzanetant is primarily metabolized via CYP3A4 enzyme. Table 3 describes drug interactions where concomitant use of another drug affects LYNKUET. Table 3: Drug Interactions: Concomitant Use of Other Drugs Affect the Use of LYNKUET Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors See www.fda.gov/CYPandTransporterInteractingDrugs for examples of strong and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, and CYP3A4 inducers. Prevention or Management Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors and grapefruit (juice): Avoid concomitant use. Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Reduce the LYNKUET dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Clinical Effect(s) Strong and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors increase elinzanetant exposure, which may increase the risk of LYNKUET-associated adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers Prevention or Management Strong and moderate CYP3A4 inducers: Avoid concomitant use. Clinical Effect(s) Strong and moderate CYP3A4 inducers decrease elinzanetant exposure, which may reduce the effectiveness of LYNKUET. 7.2 Effects of LYNKUET on Other Drugs CYP3A4 Substrates Avoid concomitant use unless otherwise recommended in the Prescribing Information for CYP3A4 substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions. See www.fda.gov/CYPandTransporterInteractingDrugs for examples of CYP3A4 substrates. Elinzanetant is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4. Concomitant use of LYNKUET increases exposure of CYP3A4 substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , which may increase the risk of adverse reactions related to these substrates.
