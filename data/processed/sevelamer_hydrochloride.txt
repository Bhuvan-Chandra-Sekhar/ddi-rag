=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between sevelamer hydrochloride and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate-release or an extended-release product. Where possible monitor clinical responses or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range. Table 4: Sevelamer Drug Interactions Oral drugs for which sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics when administered concomitantly Digoxin Enalapril Iron Metoprolol Warfarin Oral drugs that have demonstrated interaction with sevelamer and are to be dosed separately from sevelamer hydrochloride Dosing Recommendations Ciprofloxacin Mycophenolate mofetil Take at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after sevelamer Take at least 2 hours before sevelamer • When clinically significant drug interactions are expected, separate the timing of administration and monitor clinical responses or blood levels of the concomitant medication. ( 7 ) • Sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, and warfarin. ( 7 ) • Sevelamer binds ciprofloxacin and mycophenolate mofetil; dose these drugs separately from sevelamer hydrochloride. ( 7 )
