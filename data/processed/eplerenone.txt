Drug: eplerenone

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CYP3A Inhibitors: In patients with hypertension initiate at 25 mg once daily. For inadequate blood pressure response, dosing may be increased to a maximum of 25 mg twice daily. ( 2.4 , 7.1 , 12.3 ) 7.1 CYP3A Inhibitors Eplerenone metabolism is predominantly mediated via CYP3A. Do not use eplerenone with drugs that are strong inhibitors of CYP3A. [See Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .] In post-MI HFrEF patients taking a moderate CYP3A inhibitor, do not exceed 25 mg once daily. In patients with hypertension taking a moderate CYP3A inhibitor, initiate at 25 mg once daily. For inadequate blood pressure response, dosing may be increased to a maximum of 25 mg twice daily [See Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .] 7.2 Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists The risk of hyperkalemia increases when eplerenone is used in combination with an ARB. A close monitoring of serum potassium and renal function is recommended, especially in patients at risk for impaired renal function, e.g., the elderly [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1) .] 7.3 Lithium A drug interaction study of eplerenone with lithium has not been conducted. Serum lithium levels should be monitored frequently if eplerenone is administered concomitantly with lithium. 7.4 Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) A drug interaction study of eplerenone with an NSAID has not been conducted. The administration of other potassium-sparing antihypertensives with NSAIDs has been shown to reduce the antihypertensive effect in some patients and result in severe hyperkalemia in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, when eplerenone and NSAIDs are used concomitantly, monitor blood pressure and serum potassium levels.
