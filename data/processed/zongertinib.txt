Drug: zongertinib

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A Inducers : Avoid concomitant use with strong CYP3A inducers. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, increase HERNEXEOS dose. ( 7.1 ) BCRP Substrates : Avoid concomitant use with certain BCRP substrates where minimal concentration increase may lead to serious adverse reactions and consider alternative therapies. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, monitor patients closely for adverse reactions and follow recommendations provided in the BCRP substrate approved product labeling. For other BCRP substrates, monitor for increased adverse reactions and adjust the dosages of those substrates as clinically appropriate. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on HERNEXEOS Avoid concomitant use of HERNEXEOS with strong CYP3A inducers. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, increase HERNEXEOS dose as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Zongertinib is a CYP3A substrate. Strong CYP3A4 inducers decrease zongertinib exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , which may reduce effectiveness of HERNEXEOS. 7.2 Effects of HERNEXEOS on Other Drugs BCRP Substrates Avoid concomitant use of HERNEXEOS with certain BCRP substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions. If coadministration cannot be avoided, monitor for increased adverse reactions and follow recommendations provided in the approved product labeling for the BCRP substrate. For other BCRP substrates, monitor for increased adverse reactions and adjust the dosages of those substrates as clinically appropriate. Zongertinib is a BCRP inhibitor. HERNEXEOS increases exposure of BCRP substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , which may increase the risk of adverse reactions related to these substrates.
