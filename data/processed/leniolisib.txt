Drug: leniolisib

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Avoid concomitant use. ( 7.1 ) Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers: Avoid concomitant use. ( 7.1 ) BCRP, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3 Substrates: Avoid concomitant use. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on JOENJA Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant use of JOENJA with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided. JOENJA is a substrate of CYP3A4. Leniolisib exposure was increased 2-fold when co-administered with itraconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant use of JOENJA with strong and moderate CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided. JOENJA is a substrate of CYP3A4. Concomitant use of strong and moderate CYP3A4 inducers may result in reduced leniolisib exposure and thus reduced leniolisib efficacy [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.2 Effects of JOENJA on Other Drugs BCRP, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3 Substrates Concomitant use of JOENJA with BCRP, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3 substrates should be avoided. JOENJA is an inhibitor of BCRP, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3 transporters. Administration of JOENJA increases exposure of BCRP, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3 substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , which may increase the risk of adverse reactions related to these substrates.
