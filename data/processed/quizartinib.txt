7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 7: Effect of Other Drugs on VANFLYTA Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Clinical Impact VANFLYTA is a CYP3A substrate. Concomitant use of VANFLYTA with a strong CYP3A inhibitor increases quizartinib systemic exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , which may increase the risk of VANFLYTA adverse reactions. Prevention or Management Reduce the dosage of VANFLYTA [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Strong or Moderate CYP3A Inducers Clinical Impact Concomitant use of VANFLYTA with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers decreases quizartinib systemic exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , which may reduce VANFLYTA efficacy. Prevention or Management Avoid concomitant use of VANFLYTA with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . QT Interval Prolonging Drugs Clinical Impact VANFLYTA prolongs the QT/QTc interval. Coadministration of VANFLYTA with other drugs that prolong the QT interval may further increase the incidence of QT prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Prevention or Management Monitor patients more frequently with ECG if coadministration of VANFLYTA with drugs known to prolong the QT interval is required. Examples of QT prolonging drugs include but are not limited to antifungal azoles, ondansetron, granisetron, azithromycin, pentamidine, doxycycline, moxifloxacin, atovaquone, prochlorperazine, and tacrolimus. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors: Reduce the VANFLYTA dose. ( 2.4 , 7 ) Strong or Moderate CYP3A Inducers: Avoid concomitant use. ( 7 , 12.3 )
