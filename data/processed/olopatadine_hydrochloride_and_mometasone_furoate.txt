Drug: olopatadine_hydrochloride_and_mometasone_furoate

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been performed with RYALTRIS. The drug interactions of the combination are expected to reflect those of the individual components [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.1 Central Nervous System Depressants Concurrent use of RYALTRIS with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants should be avoided because somnolence and impairment of central nervous system performance may occur [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 7.2 Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Studies have shown that mometasone furoate, a component of RYALTRIS, is primarily and extensively metabolized to multiple metabolites. In vitro studies have confirmed the primary role of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 in the metabolism of this compound. Concomitant administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors may inhibit the metabolism of, and increase the mometasone furoate plasma concentration and potentially increase the risk for adverse reactions. Caution should be exercised when considering the coadministration of RYALTRIS with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] .
