7 DRUG INTERACTIONS MOUNJARO delays gastric emptying and has the potential to impact the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Concomitant Use with an Insulin Secretagogue (e.g., Sulfonylurea) or with Insulin When initiating MOUNJARO, consider reducing the dose of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylureas) or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. 7.2 Oral Medications MOUNJARO delays gastric emptying and thereby has the potential to impact the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. Caution should be exercised when oral medications are concomitantly administered with MOUNJARO. Monitor patients on oral medications dependent on threshold concentrations for efficacy and those with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., warfarin) when concomitantly administered with MOUNJARO. Advise patients using oral hormonal contraceptives to switch to a non-oral contraceptive method or add a barrier method of contraception for 4 weeks after initiation and for 4 weeks after each dose escalation with MOUNJARO. Hormonal contraceptives that are not administered orally should not be affected [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 , 12.3 )].
