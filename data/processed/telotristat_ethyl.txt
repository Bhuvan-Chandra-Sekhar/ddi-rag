7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CYP3A4 Substrates (e.g., midazolam): Efficacy of concomitant drugs may be decreased; monitor for suboptimal efficacy and consider increasing the dose of the concomitant drug. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 CYP3A4 Substrates Concomitant use of Xermelo may decrease the efficacy of drugs that are CYP3A4 substrates (e.g., midazolam) by decreasing their systemic exposure. Monitor for suboptimal efficacy and consider increasing the dose for concomitant CYP3A4 substrates, if necessary [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.2 Short-Acting Octreotide Concurrent administration of short-acting octreotide with Xermelo significantly decreased the systemic exposure of telotristat ethyl and telotristat, the active metabolite. If treatment with short-acting octreotide is needed in combination with Xermelo, administer short-acting octreotide at least 30 minutes after administration of Xermelo [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ), Clinical Studies ( 14 )] .
