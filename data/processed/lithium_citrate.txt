=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Diuretics, NSAID, renin-angiotensin system antagonists, or metronidazole may increase lithium serum concentrations. Recommend frequent monitoring of serum lithium concentration and adjust dosage when necessary. ( 2.3 , 7.1 ) Serotonergic Agents: Increased risk of serotonin syndrome when co administered with lithium. ( 5.6 , 7.1 ) Antipsychotics: There have been reports of neurologic adverse reactions in patients treated with lithium and an antipsychotic, ranging from extrapyramidal symptoms to neuroleptic malignant syndrome. ( 5.5 , 7.1 ) 7.1 Drugs Having Clinically Important Interactions with Lithium Table 4: Clinically Important Drug Interactions with Lithium Diuretics Clinical Impact: Diuretic-induced sodium loss may reduce lithium clearance and increase serum lithium concentrations. Intervention: More frequent monitoring of serum electrolyte and lithium concentrations. Reduce lithium dosage based on serum lithium concentration and clinical response [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warning and Precautions (5.3) ] Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs(NSAID) Clinical Impact: NSAID decrease renal blood flow, resulting in decreased renal clearance and increase serum lithium concentrations. Intervention: More frequent serum lithium concentration monitoring. Reduce lithium dosage based on serum lithium concentration and clinical response [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Renin-Angiotensin System Antagonists Clinical Impact: Concomitant use increase steady-state serum lithium concentrations. Intervention: More frequent monitoring of serum lithium concentrations. Reduce lithium dosage based on serum lithium concentration and clinical response [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact: Concomitant use can precipitate serotonin syndrome. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during lithium initiation. If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider discontinuation of lithium and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Nitroimidazole Antibiotics Clinical Impact: Concomitant use may increase serum lithium concentrations due to reduced renal clearance. Intervention: More frequent monitoring of serum lithium concentration. Reduce lithium dosage based on serum lithium concentration and clinical response [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Acetazolamide, Urea, Xanthine Preparations, Alkalinizing Agents Clinical Impact: Concomitant use can lower serum lithium concentrations by increasing urinary lithium excretion. Intervention: More frequent serum lithium concentration monitoring. Increase lithium dosage based on serum lithium concentration and clinical response [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Methyldopa, Phenytoin and Carbamazepine Clinical Impact: Concomitant use may increase risk of adverse reactions of these drugs. Intervention: Monitor patients closely for adverse reactions of methyldopa, phenytoin, and carbamazepine. Iodide Preparations Clinical Impact: Concomitant use may produce hypothyroidism. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Calcium Channel Blocking Agents (CCB) Clinical Impact: Concomitant use may increase the risk of neurologic adverse reactions in the form of ataxia, tremors, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and/or tinnitus. Intervention: Monitor for neurologic adverse reactions. Atypical and Typical Antipsychotic Drugs Clinical Impact: Reports of neurotoxic reactions in patients treated with both lithium and an antipsychotic, ranging from extrapyramidal symptoms to neuroleptic malignant syndrome, as well as reports of a encephalopathic syndrome in few patients treated with concomitant therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Intervention: Monitor for neurologic adverse reactions. Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibtor Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of lithium with an SGLT2 inhibitor may decrease serum lithium concentrations. Intervention: Monitor serum lithium concentration more frequently during SGLT2 inhibitor initiation and dosage changes. Neuromuscular Blocking Agents Clinical Impact: Lithium may prolong the effects of neuromuscular blocking agents. Intervention: Monitor for prolonged paralysis.
