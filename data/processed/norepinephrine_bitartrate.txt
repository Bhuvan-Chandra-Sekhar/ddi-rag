Drug: norepinephrine_bitartrate

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) or antidepressants of the triptyline or imipramine types may result in hypertension. ( 7.1 ) • Cyclopropane and halothane anesthetics increase cardiac autonomic irritability. ( 7.4 ) 7.1 MAO-Inhibiting Drugs Co-administration of norepinephrine with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or other drugs with MAO-inhibiting properties (e.g., linezolid) can cause severe, prolonged hypertension. If administration of norepinephrine cannot be avoided in patients who recently have received any of these drugs and in whom, after discontinuation, MAO activity has not yet sufficiently recovered, monitor for hypertension. 7.2 Tricyclic Antidepressants Co-administration of norepinephrine with tricyclic antidepressants (including amitriptyline, nortriptyline, protriptyline, clomipramine, desipramine, imipramine) can cause severe, prolonged hypertension. If administration of norepinephrine cannot be avoided in these patients, monitor for hypertension. 7.3 Antidiabetics Norepinephrine can decrease insulin sensitivity and raise blood glucose. Monitor glucose and consider dosage adjustment of antidiabetic drugs. 7.4 Halogenated Anesthetics Concomitant use of norepinephrine with halogenated anesthetics (e.g., cyclopropane, desflurane, enflurane, isoflurane, and sevoflurane) may lead to ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Monitor cardiac rhythm in patients receiving concomitant halogenated anesthetics.
