Drug: iopamidol

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Drug-Drug Interactions Metformin In patients with renal impairment, metformin can cause lactic acidosis. Iodinated contrast agents appear to increase the risk of metformin-induced lactic acidosis, possibly as a result of worsening renal function. Stop metformin at the time of, or prior to, iopamidol injection administration in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast agents. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure and reinstitute metformin use only after renal function is stable. Radioactive Iodine Administration of iopamidol injection may interfere with thyroid uptake of radioactive iodine (I-131 and I-123) and decrease therapeutic and diagnostic efficacy. Avoid thyroid therapy or testing for up to 6 weeks post iopamidol injection 7.2 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Protein-Bound Iodine Test Iodinated contrast agents, including iopamidol injection, will temporarily increase protein-bound iodine in blood. Avoid protein-bound iodine test for at least 16 days following administration of iopamidol injection . However, thyroid function tests that do not depend on iodine estimations, e.g., triiodothyronine (T 3 ) resin uptake and total or free thyroxine (T 4 ) assays, are not affected.
