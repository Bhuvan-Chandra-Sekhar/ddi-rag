Drug: abacavir

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Methadone: An increased methadone dose may be required in a small number of patients. ( 7.1 ) • Riociguat: The riociguat dose may need to be reduced. ( 7.2 ) 7. 1 Methadone In a trial of 11 HIV-1-infected subjects receiving methadone-maintenance therapy with 600 mg of abacavir twice daily (twice the currently recommended dose), oral methadone clearance increased [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. This alteration will not result in a methadone dose modification in the majority of patients; however, an increased methadone dose may be required in a small number of patients. 7.2 Riociguat Coadministration with fixed-dose abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine resulted in increased riociguat exposure, which may increase the risk of riociguat adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. The riociguat dose may need to be reduced. See full prescribing information for ADEMPAS (riociguat).
