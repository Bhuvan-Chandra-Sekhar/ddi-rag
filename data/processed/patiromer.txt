Drug: patiromer

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Veltassa has the potential to bind some oral co-administered medications, which could decrease their gastrointestinal absorption. Binding of Veltassa to other oral medications not listed in Table 3 below could cause decreased gastrointestinal absorption and loss of efficacy when taken close to the time Veltassa is administered. Administer other oral medications at least 3 hours before or 3 hours after Veltassa [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Take other orally administered drugs at least 3 hours before or 3 hours after Veltassa except those shown to not have a clinically important interaction. ( 2.1 , 7 ) 7.1 Clinically Important Interaction of Veltassa with Other Drugs The in-vitro binding of the following drugs to patiromer was evaluated and potentially clinically significant binding was observed. Some drugs were subsequently tested in-vivo and significant reduction in systemic exposure was observed [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Binding by Veltassa may reduce the systemic exposure and decrease the clinical efficacy of the co-administered drugs shown in Table 2. The administration of these drugs (and any drugs not listed in Table 3) should be separated by at least 3 hours from Veltassa. Table 2: Clinically important drug interactions of Veltassa Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) Telmisartan β-adrenoceptor blockers (β-blocker) Bisoprolol, carvedilol, nebivolol Antibiotics Ciprofloxacin Anti-Parathyroid Agents and Thyroid Preparations Levothyroxine Blood Glucose Lowering Drugs Metformin Immunosuppressants Mycophenolate mofetil Others Quinidine, thiamine 7.2 No Observed Clinically Important Interaction of Veltassa with Other Drugs The binding of the following drugs to patiromer was evaluated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] and no clinically significant binding was observed. No separation of dosing is required for these drugs.
