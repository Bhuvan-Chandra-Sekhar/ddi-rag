Drug: iohexol

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Drug-Drug Interactions Metformin In patients with renal impairment, metformin can cause lactic acidosis. Iodinated contrast agents appear to increase the risk of metformin-induced lactic acidosis, possibly as a result of worsening renal function. Stop metformin at the time of, or prior to, iohexol injection administration in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and reinstitute metformin only after renal function is stable. Radioactive Iodine Iohexol may interfere with thyroid uptake of radioactive iodine (I-131 and I-123) and decrease therapeutic and diagnostic efficacy. Avoid thyroid therapy or testing for up to 6 weeks post iohexol injection. 7.2 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Protein-Bound Iodine Test Iodinated contrast agents, including iohexol, will temporarily increase protein-bound iodine in blood. Do not perform protein-bound iodine test for at least 16 days following administration of iohexol injection. However, thyroid function tests that do not depend on iodine estimation, e.g., T3 resin uptake or direct thyroxine assays, are not affected.
