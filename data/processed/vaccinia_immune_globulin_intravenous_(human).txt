Drug: vaccinia_immune_globulin_intravenous_(human)

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Efficacy of live attenuated virus vaccines may be impaired by immune globulin administration; revaccination may be necessary ( 7.1 ) • Antibodies in VIGIV may interfere with some serological tests ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Live, Attenuated Vaccines Immune globulin administration may impair the efficacy of live attenuated vaccines such as measles, rubella, mumps and varicella. Defer vaccination with live virus vaccines until approximately three months after administration of VIGIV. Revaccinate people who received VIGIV shortly after live virus vaccination three months after the administration of the VIGIV. 7.2 Drug/Laboratory Interactions • VIGIV contains maltose, which can be misinterpreted as glucose by certain types of blood glucose testing systems (for example, those based on the GDH-PQQ or glucose-dye-oxidoreductase methods). Due to the potential for falsely elevated glucose readings, only use testing systems that are glucose-specific to test or monitor blood glucose levels in patients receiving VIGIV [see BOXED WARNING and 5.3 Blood Glucose Monitoring ]. • Antibodies present in VIGIV may interfere with some serological tests. After administration of immune globulins like VIGIV, a transitory increase of passively transferred antibodies in the patient’s blood may result in positive results in serological testing (e.g. Coombs’ test) [see 5.5 Hemolysis ].
