6. DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis Monitor patients with concomitant use of diclofenac sodium external with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for signs of bleeding. Aspirin Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium external and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding. ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Beta-Blockers When these drugs are administered concomitantly, patients should be adequately hydrated. Assess renal function at the beginning of the concomitant treatment. Diuretics During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium external with diuretics, observe patients for signs of worsening renal function, in addition to assuring diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects. Digoxin During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium external and digoxin, monitor serum digoxin levels. Lithium During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium external and lithium, monitor patients for signs of lithium toxicity. Methotrexate During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium external and methotrexate, monitor patients for methotrexate toxicity. Cyclosporine During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium external and cyclosporine, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. Pemetrexed Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium external and pemetrexed may increase the risk of pemetrexed-associated myelosuppression, renal, and GI toxicity.
