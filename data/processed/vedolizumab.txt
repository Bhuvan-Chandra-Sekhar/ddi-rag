Drug: vedolizumab

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Natalizumab Products Because of the potential for increased risk of PML and other infections, avoid the concomitant use of ENTYVIO with natalizumab products. 7.2 TNF Blockers Because of the potential for increased risk of infections, avoid the concomitant use of ENTYVIO with TNF blockers. 7.3 CYP450 Substrates The formation of CYP450 enzymes may be suppressed by increased levels of certain cytokines (e.g., IL-6, IL-10, TNFα, IFN) during chronic inflammation. Therefore, use of ENTYVIO may normalize the formation of CYP450 enzymes by modulating the underlying disease. Upon initiation or discontinuation of ENTYVIO in patients treated with CYP450 substrates, monitor drug concentrations or other therapeutic parameters, and adjust the dosage of the CYP substrate as needed. See the prescribing information of specific CYP substrates.
