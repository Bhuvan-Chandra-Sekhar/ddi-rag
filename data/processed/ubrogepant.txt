Drug: ubrogepant

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A4 Inducers: Should be avoided as concomitant use will result in reduction of ubrogepant exposure. ( 2.2 , 7.2 ) For additional dose modifications for moderate or weak CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers or BCRP and/or P-gp only inhibitors, refer to section 2.2 . ( 7.1 , 7.2 , 7.3 ) 7.1 CYP3A4 I nhibitors Co-administration of UBRELVY with ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, resulted in a significant increase in exposure of ubrogepant [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . UBRELVY should not be used with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin) [see Contraindication s ( 4 )] . Co-administration of UBRELVY with verapamil, a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, resulted in an increase in ubrogepant exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . Dose adjustment is recommended with concomitant use of UBRELVY and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine, ciprofloxacin, fluconazole, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . No dedicated drug interaction study was conducted with ubrogepant and weak CYP3A4 inhibitors. Dose adjustment is recommended with concomitant use of UBRELVY with weak CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 7.2 CYP3A4 I nducers Co-administration of UBRELVY with rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, resulted in a significant reduction in ubrogepant exposure [ s ee Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . In patients taking strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, barbiturates, rifampin, St. John’s Wort), loss of ubrogepant efficacy is expected, and concomitant use should be avoided. Co-administration of UBRELVY with moderate or weak CYP3A4 inducers was not evaluated in a clinical study. Dose adjustment is recommended with concomitant use of UBRELVY and moderate or weak CYP3A4 inducers [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 7 .3 BCRP and / or P-gp Only Inhibitors Ubrogepant is a substrate of BCRP and P-gp efflux transporters. Use of BCRP and/or P-gp only inhibitors (e.g., quinidine, carvedilol, eltrombopag, curcumin) may increase the exposure of ubrogepant [ s ee Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . Clinical drug interaction studies with inhibitors of these transporters were not conducted. Dose adjustment is recommended with BCRP and/or P-gp only inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ] .
