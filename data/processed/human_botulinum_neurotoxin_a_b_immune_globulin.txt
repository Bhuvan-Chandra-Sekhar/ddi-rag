=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Admixtures of BabyBIG with other drugs have not been evaluated. It is recommended that BabyBIG be administered separately from other drugs or medications that the patient may be receiving [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2) ]. Antibodies present in immune globulin preparations may interfere with the immune response to live virus vaccines such as polio, measles, mumps, and rubella; therefore, vaccination with live virus vaccines such as MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella), MMRV (measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella), and monovalent varicella vaccines should be deferred until six months after administration of BabyBIG. This interval may be shortened if exposure to measles is likely. If such vaccinations were given shortly before or after BabyBIG administration, revaccination may be necessary. [21] The passive transfer of antibodies may interfere with the response to live viral vaccines ( 7 ).
