Drug: rimabotulinumtoxinb

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Co-administration with aminoglycosides or other agents interfering with neuromuscular transmission may potentiate effects of MYOBLOC ( 7.1 ) Co-administration or overlapping of botulinum toxin serotypes (within 4 months) may potentiate neuromuscular paralysis ( 7.3 ) 7.1 Aminoglycosides and Other Agents Interfering with Neuromuscular Transmission Co-administration of MYOBLOC and aminoglycosides or other agents interfering with neuromuscular transmission (e.g., curare-like compounds) should only be performed with caution as the effect of the toxin may be potentiated. 7.2 Anticholinergic Drugs Use of anticholinergic drugs after administration of MYOBLOC may potentiate systemic anticholinergic effects. 7.3 Other Botulinum Neurotoxin Products The effect of administering different botulinum toxin products at the same time or within several months of each other is unknown. Excessive neuromuscular weakness may be exacerbated by administration of another botulinum toxin prior to the resolution of the effects of a previously administered botulinum toxin. 7.4 Muscle Relaxants Excessive weakness may also be exaggerated by administration of a muscle relaxant before or after administration of MYOBLOC.
