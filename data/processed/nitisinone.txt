Drug: nitisinone

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Nitisinone is a moderate CYP2C9 inhibitor, a weak CYP2E1 inducer and an inhibitor of OAT1/OAT3. Table 2 includes drugs with clinically important drug interactions when administered concomitantly with nitisinone and instructions for preventing or managing them. Table 2: Clinically Relevant Interactions Affecting Co-Administered Drugs Sensitive CYP2C9 Substrates (e.g., celecoxib, tolbutamide) or CYP2C9 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index (e.g., phenytoin, warfarin) Clinical Impact Increased exposure of the co-administered drugs metabolized by CYP2C9. [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] Intervention Reduce the dosage of the co-administered drugs metabolized by CYP2C9 drug by half. Additional dosage adjustments may be needed to maintain therapeutic drug concentrations for narrow therapeutic index drugs. See prescribing information for those drugs. OAT1/OAT3 Substrates (e.g., adefovir, ganciclovir, methotrexate) Clinical Impact Increased exposure of the interacting drug [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] Intervention Monitor for potential adverse reactions related to the co-administered drug. CYP2C9 Substrates : Increased systemic exposure of these co-administered drugs; reduce the dosage. Additional dosage adjustments may be needed to maintain therapeutic drug concentrations for narrow therapeutic index drugs. ( 7 ) OAT1/OAT3 Substrates : Increased systemic exposure of these co-administered drugs; monitor for potential adverse reactions. ( 7 ) Additional pediatric use information is approved for Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB PUBL's Orfadin (nitisinone) capsules. However, due to Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB PUBL's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information.
