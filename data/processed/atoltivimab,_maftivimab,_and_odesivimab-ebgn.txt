=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Interaction with live vaccine indicated for prevention of Orthoebolavirus zairense infection: No vaccine interaction studies have been performed. INMAZEB may reduce the efficacy of the live vaccine. The interval between live vaccination following initiation of INMAZEB therapy should be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Vaccine Interactions No vaccine-therapeutic interaction studies have been performed in human subjects using INMAZEB. However, because of the potential for INMAZEB to inhibit replication of a live vaccine virus indicated for prevention of Orthoebolavirus zairense infection and possibly reduce the efficacy of the vaccine, avoid the concurrent administration of a live vaccine during treatment with INMAZEB. The interval between live vaccination following initiation of INMAZEB therapy should be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines. The efficacy of INMAZEB among subjects who reported receipt of a recombinant live vaccine prior to their enrollment in the PALM clinical trial was similar to subjects who did not receive a vaccine.
