Drug: regorafenib

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Strong CYP3A4 inducers: Avoid strong CYP3A4 inducers. ( 7.1 ) • Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors: Avoid strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. ( 7.2 ) • BCRP substrates: Monitor patients closely for symptoms of increased exposure to BCRP substrates. ( 7.3 ) 7.1 Effect of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers on Regorafenib Co-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inducer with STIVARGA decreased the plasma concentrations of regorafenib, increased the plasma concentrations of the active metabolite M-5, and resulted in no change in the plasma concentrations of the active metabolite M-2 [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , and may lead to decreased efficacy. Avoid concomitant use of STIVARGA with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and St. John's Wort). 7.2 Effect of Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors on Regorafenib Co-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor with STIVARGA increased the plasma concentrations of regorafenib and decreased the plasma concentrations of the active metabolites M-2 and M-5 [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , and may lead to increased toxicity. Avoid concomitant use of STIVARGA with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. clarithromycin, grapefruit juice, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, posaconazole, telithromycin, and voriconazole). 7.3 Effect of Regorafenib on Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) Substrates Co-administration of STIVARGA with a BCRP substrate increased the plasma concentrations of the BCRP substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of exposure related toxicity to the BCRP substrate (e.g. methotrexate, fluvastatin, atorvastatin). Consult the concomitant BCRP substrate product information when considering administration of such products together with STIVARGA.
