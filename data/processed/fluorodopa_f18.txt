Drug: fluorodopa_f18

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitors Prior to Fluorodopa F 18 Injection administration, use of AADC inhibitors (e.g. carbidopa, benserazide etc.) may increase Fluorodopa F 18 bioavailability to the brain by inhibiting peripheral decarboxylase activity and restricting peripheral Fluorodopa F 18 metabolism [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Dopamine agonists, dopamine reuptake inhibitors, dopamine releasing agents (DRAs), peripheral catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors, and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors Therapy for Parkinson’s syndromes includes dopamine agonists, dopamine reuptake inhibitors, dopamine releasing agents (DRAs) such as psychostimulants of the amphetamine class, peripheral catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors, and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. Whether discontinuation of these drugs prior to Fluorodopa F 18 administration may minimize the interference with a Fluorodopa F 18 image is not fully known; however, if use of these drugs can be safely suspended, discontinue use 12 hours before administration of Fluorodopa F18 Injection [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] .
