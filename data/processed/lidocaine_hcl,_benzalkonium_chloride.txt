Drug Interactions Antiarrhythmic Drugs: Diabecin HR™ Cream should be used with caution in patients receiving Class I antiarrhythmic drugs (such as tocainide and mexiletine) since the toxic effects are additive and potentially synergistic. Local Anesthetics: When Diabecin HR™ Cream is used concomitantly with other products containing local anesthetic agents, the amount absorbed from all formulations must be considered.
