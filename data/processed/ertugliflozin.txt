7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 3: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with STEGLATRO Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues Clinical Impact: The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when STEGLATRO is used in combination with insulin or an insulin secretagogue. Intervention: A lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with STEGLATRO. Lithium Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of an SGLT2 inhibitor with lithium may decrease serum lithium concentrations. Intervention: Monitor serum lithium concentration more frequently during STEGLATRO initiation and dosage changes. Positive Urine Glucose Test Clinical Impact: SGLT2 inhibitors increase urinary glucose excretion and will lead to positive urine glucose tests. Intervention: Monitoring glycemic control with urine glucose tests is not recommended in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Use alternative methods to monitor glycemic control. Interference with 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) Assay Clinical Impact: Measurements of 1,5-AG are unreliable in assessing glycemic control in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Intervention: Monitoring glycemic control with 1,5-AG assay is not recommended. Use alternative methods to monitor glycemic control. See full prescribing information for information on drug interactions and interference of STEGLATRO with laboratory tests. ( 7 )
