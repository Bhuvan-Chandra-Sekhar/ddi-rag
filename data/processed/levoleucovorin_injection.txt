=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Effects of Leucovorin Products on Other Drugs Antiepileptic Drugs Folic acid in large amounts may counteract the antiepileptic effect of phenobarbital, phenytoin and primidone and increase the frequency of seizures in susceptible children. It is not known whether folinic acid has the same effects; however, both folic and folinic acids share some common metabolic pathways. Monitor patients taking folinic acid in combination with antiepileptic drugs. Fluorouracil Leucovorin products increase the toxicity of fluorouracil. Do not initiate or continue therapy with levoleucovorin and fluorouracil in patients with symptoms of gastrointestinal toxicity until those symptoms have resolved. Monitor patients with diarrhea until the diarrhea has resolved, as rapid deterioration leading to death can occur [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole The concomitant use of d,l -leucovorin with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for the acute treatment of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in patients with HIV infection was associated with increased rates of treatment failure and morbidity in a placebo-controlled study [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] .
