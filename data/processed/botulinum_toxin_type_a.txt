=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of DYSPORT and aminoglycosides or other agents interfering with neuromuscular transmission or muscle relaxants, should be observed closely because the effect of DYSPORT may be potentiated (7.1, 7.4) Anticholinergic drugs may potentiate systemic anticholinergic effects (7.2) The effect of administering different botulinum neurotoxins during the course of treatment with DYSPORT is unknown (7.3) 7.1 Aminoglycosides and Other Agents Interfering with Neuromuscular Transmission Co-administration of DYSPORT and aminoglycosides or other agents interfering with neuromuscular transmission (e.g., curare-like agents) should only be performed with caution because the effect of the botulinum toxin may be potentiated. If co-administered, observe the patient closely. 7.2 Anticholinergic Drugs Use of anticholinergic drugs after administration of DYSPORT may potentiate systemic anticholinergic effects such as blurred vision. 7.3 Other Botulinum Neurotoxin Products The effect of administering botulinum neurotoxin products including DYSPORT, at the same time or within several months of each other is unknown. Excessive weakness may be exacerbated by another administration of botulinum toxin prior to the resolution of the effects of a previously administered botulinum toxin. 7.4 Muscle Relaxants Excessive weakness may also be exaggerated by administration of a muscle relaxant before or after administration of DYSPORT.
