Drug: brincidofovir

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use with OATP1B1 and 1B3 inhibitors increase TEMBEXA exposure which may increase TEMBEXA-associated adverse reactions. Consider alternative medication that are not OATP1B1 or 1B3 inhibitors. If concomitant use is necessary, increase monitoring for adverse reactions associated with TEMBEXA and postpone the dosing of OATP1B1 or 1B3 inhibitors at least 3 hours after TEMBEXA administration. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on TEMBEXA Inhibitors for Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 and 1B3 Concomitant use of TEMBEXA with OATP1B1 and 1B3 inhibitors (clarithromycin, cyclosporine, erythromycin, gemfibrozil, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] and hepatitis C virus [HCV] protease inhibitors, rifampin [single dose]) increase brincidofovir AUC and C max which may increase TEMBEXA-associated adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Where possible, consider alternative medications that are not OATP1B1 or 1B3 inhibitors. If concomitant use with TEMBEXA is necessary, increase monitoring for adverse reactions associated with TEMBEXA (elevations in transaminases and bilirubin, diarrhea, or other GI adverse events) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 )] and postpone the dosing of OATP1B1 or 1B3 inhibitors for at least 3 hours after TEMBEXA administration. 7.2 Vaccine Interactions No vaccine-drug interaction studies have been performed in human subjects. Animal studies have indicated that coadministration of TEMBEXA at the same time as live smallpox vaccine (vaccinia virus) may reduce the immune response to the vaccine. It is also possible that TEMBEXA may reduce the immune response to replication-defective smallpox vaccine (modified vaccinia virus Ankara). The clinical impacts of these potential interactions on vaccine efficacy are unknown.
