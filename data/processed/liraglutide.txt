Drug: liraglutide

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Oral Medications: VICTOZA delays gastric emptying and may impact absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications ( 7 ). Concomitant Use with an Insulin Secretagogue (e.g., Sulfonylurea) or with Insulin: when initiating, consider reducing the dose of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues (such as sulfonylureas) or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia ( 7 ). 7.1 Oral Medications VICTOZA causes a delay of gastric emptying, and thereby has the potential to impact the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. In clinical pharmacology trials, VICTOZA did not affect the absorption of the tested orally administered medications to any clinically relevant degree. Nonetheless, caution should be exercised when oral medications are concomitantly administered with VICTOZA. 7.2 Concomitant Use with an Insulin Secretagogue (e.g., Sulfonylurea) or with Insulin When initiating VICTOZA, consider reducing the dose of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues (such as sulfonylureas) or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 )].
