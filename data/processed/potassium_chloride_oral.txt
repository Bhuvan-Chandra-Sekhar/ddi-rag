7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Potassium sparing diuretics: Avoid concomitant use ( 7.1 ) Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors: Monitor for hyperkalemia ( 7.2 ) Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory drugs: Monitor for hyperkalemia ( 7.3 ) 7.1 Potassium-Sparing Diuretics Use with potassium-sparing diuretics can produce severe hyperkalemia. Avoid concomitant use. 7.2 Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System Inhibitors Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), spironolactone, eplerenone, or aliskiren produce potassium retention by inhibiting aldosterone production. Closely monitor potassium in patients receiving concomitant RAAS therapy. 7.3 Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) NSAIDs may produce potassium retention by reducing renal synthesis of prostaglandin E and impairing the renin‑angiotensin system. Closely monitor potassium in patients on concomitant NSAIDs.
