Drug: pivmecillinam

=== Drug Interactions ===
7. DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Other Pivalate-Generating Drugs Avoid concurrent treatment with valproic acid, valproate, or other pivalate-generating drugs. If concomitant use with PIVYA is necessary, counsel patients to monitor adverse reactions associated with carnitine depletion (e.g., hypoglycemia, muscle aches, fatigue, and confusion) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Pivmecillinam is a pivalate-generating prodrug [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Pivalate can be activated to a coenzyme-A thioester in cells which is further converted to pivaloylcarnitine and excreted in urine. Pivalate elimination associated with concomitant use of pivmecillinam with other pivalate-generating drugs decreases carnitine concentrations in plasma which may increase the risk of carnitine depletion-associated adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . 7.2 Methotrexate Clearance of methotrexate from the body can be reduced by concurrent use of drugs in the penicillin class, including PIVYA. Where possible, consider alternative therapy. 7.3 Drug Interference with Newborn Screening Test Treatment of a pregnant individual with PIVYA prior to delivery may cause a false positive test for isovaleric acidemia in the newborn as part of newborn screening. Prompt follow-up of a positive newborn screening result for isovaleric acidemia is recommended.
