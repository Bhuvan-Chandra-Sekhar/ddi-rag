Drug: fedratinib_hydrochloride

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Reduce INREBIC dose as recommended ( 2.3 , 7.1 ). • Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers: Avoid use of INREBIC ( 7.1 ). • CYP3A4, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 Substrates: Dose modifications of substrates drugs may be needed ( 7.2 ). • OCT2 and MATE1/2-K Substrates: Dose modifications of substrate drugs may be needed ( 7.2 ). 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on INREBIC Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Coadministration of INREBIC with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor increases fedratinib exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Increased exposure may increase the risk of adverse reactions. Consider alternative therapies that do not strongly inhibit CYP3A4 activity. Alternatively, reduce the dose of INREBIC when administering with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers Coadministration of INREBIC with a strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducer can decrease fedratinib exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Decreased exposure may reduce the effectiveness of INREBIC. Avoid INREBIC with strong and moderate CYP3A4 inducers. Dual CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 Inhibitors Coadministration of INREBIC with a dual CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 inhibitor increases fedratinib exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Increased exposure may increase the risk of adverse reactions. Due to potential increase of exposure, patients taking concomitant dual CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 inhibitors require more intensive safety monitoring and, if necessary, dose modifications of INREBIC based on adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . 7.2 Effect of INREBIC on Other Drugs CYP3A4, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 Substrate Drugs Coadministration of INREBIC with drugs that are CYP3A4 substrates, CYP2C19 substrates, or CYP2D6 substrates increases the concentrations of these drugs, which may increase the risk of adverse reactions of these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Monitor for adverse reactions and adjust the dose of drugs that are CYP3A4, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 substrates as necessary when coadministered with INREBIC. OCT2 and MATE1/2-K Substrate Drugs Coadministration of INREBIC with drugs that are renally excreted via organic cation transporter (OCT2) and multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE)1/2-K can decrease renal clearance of those drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Monitor for adverse reactions and consider dose modifications for drugs that are renally excreted via OCT2 or MATE1/2-K (e.g., metformin), as necessary when coadministered with INREBIC.
