Drug: cyclobenzaprine_hcl_er

=== Drug Interactions ===
Based on its structural similarity to tricyclic antidepressants, cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release may have life-threatening interactions with MAO inhibitors [SEE CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)], may enhance the effects of alcohol, barbiturates, and other CNS depressants, may enhance the seizure risk in patients taking tramadol, or may block the antihypertensive action of guanethidine and similarly acting compounds. Postmarketing cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during combined use of cyclobenzaprine and other drugs, such as SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, tramadol, bupropion, meperidine, verapamil, or MAO inhibitors [SEE WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)].
