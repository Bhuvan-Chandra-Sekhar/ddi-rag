7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Effects of VORAXAZE on Leucovorin VORAXAZE can decrease leucovorin concentration, which may decrease the effect of leucovorin rescue unless leucovorin is dosed as recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . VORAXAZE may also reduce the concentrations other folate analogs or folate analog metabolic inhibitors. 7.2 Effect of VORAXAZE on Measurement of Methotrexate Concentration DAMPA (4-deoxy-4-amino-N10- methylpteroic acid), an inactive metabolite of methotrexate formed following VORAXAZE administration, interferes with the measurement of methotrexate concentration using immunoassays. This interference results in an overestimation of the methotrexate concentration. Based on the half-life of DAMPA, VORAXAZE may interfere with the measurement of methotrexate concentrations for approximately 48 hours following a VORAXAZE dose [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . When measuring methotrexate concentration following a VORAXAZE dose, a chromatographic method is preferred over an immunoassay.
