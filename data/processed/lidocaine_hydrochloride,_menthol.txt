=== Drug Interactions ===
Drug Interactions Antiarrhythmic Drugs: Lidotral™ 5% with Menthol Spray should be used with caution in patients receiving Class I antiarrhythmic drugs (such as tocainide and mexiletine) since the toxic effects are additive and potentially synergistic. Local Anesthetics: When Lidotral™ 5% with Menthol Spray is used concomitantly with other products containing local anesthetic agents, the amount absorbed from all formulations must be considered.
