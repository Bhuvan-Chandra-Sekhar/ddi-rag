Drug: ripretinib

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A Inhibitors : Monitor more frequently for adverse reactions. ( 7.1 ) Strong CYP3A Inducers : Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers. ( 7.1 ) Moderate CYP3A Inducers : Avoid concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inducers. If a moderate CYP inducer cannot be avoided, increase ripretinib dose frequency to twice daily. ( 2.3 , 7.1 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on QINLOCK Table 4 includes drug interactions that affect the pharmacokinetics of ripretinib. Table 4: Drug Interactions that Affect QINLOCK Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Clinical Impact Coadministration of QINLOCK with a strong CYP3A inhibitor increased the exposure of ripretinib and its active metabolite (DP-5439), which may increase the risk of adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Prevention or Management Monitor patients more frequently for adverse reactions. Strong and Moderate CYP3A Inducers Clinical Impact Coadministration of QINLOCK with a strong CYP3A inducer decreased the exposure of ripretinib and its active metabolite (DP-5439), which may decrease QINLOCK anti-tumor activity [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Coadministration of QINLOCK with moderate CYP3A inducers is predicted to decrease the exposure of ripretinib and its active metabolite (DP-5439), which may decrease QINLOCK anti-tumor activity [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Prevention or Management Avoid concomitant use of QINLOCK with strong CYP3A inducers. Avoid concomitant use of QINLOCK with moderate CYP3A inducers. If a moderate CYP3A inducer cannot be avoided, increase QINLOCK dosing frequency from the recommended dose of 150 mg once daily to 150 mg twice daily during the co-administration period. Monitor for clinical response and tolerability [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] .
