=== Drug Interactions ===
Drug Interactions The risks of using clomipramine in combination with other drugs have not been systematically evaluated. Given the primary CNS effects of clomipramine, caution is advised in using it concomitantly with other CNS-active drugs ( see Information for Patients ). Clomipramine should not be used with MAO inhibitors ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Close supervision and careful adjustment of dosage are required when clomipramine hydrochloride capsules is administered with anticholinergic or sympathomimetic drugs. Several tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to block the pharmacologic effects of guanethidine, clonidine, or similar agents, and such an effect may be anticipated with CMI because of its structural similarity to other tricyclic antidepressants. The plasma concentration of CMI has been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of haloperidol; plasma levels of several closely related tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of methylphenidate or hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluoxetine) and decreased by the concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and such an effect may be anticipated with CMI as well. Administration of CMI has been reported to increase the plasma levels of phenobarbital, if given concomitantly ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Interactions ).
