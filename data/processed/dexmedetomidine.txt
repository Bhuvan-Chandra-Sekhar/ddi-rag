Drug: dexmedetomidine

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Anesthetics, Sedatives, Hypnotics, Opioids Co-administration of dexmedetomidine injection with anesthetics, sedatives, hypnotics, and opioids is likely to lead to an enhancement of effects. Specific studies have confirmed these effects with sevoflurane, isoflurane, propofol, alfentanil, and midazolam. No pharmacokinetic interactions between dexmedetomidine injection and isoflurane, propofol, alfentanil and midazolam have been demonstrated. However, due to possible pharmacodynamic interactions, when co-administered with dexmedetomidine injection, a reduction in dosage of dexmedetomidine injection or the concomitant anesthetic, sedative, hypnotic or opioid may be required. 7.2 Neuromuscular Blockers In one study of 10 healthy adult volunteers, administration of dexmedetomidine injection for 45 minutes at a plasma concentration of one ng/mL resulted in no clinically meaningful increases in the magnitude of neuromuscular blockade associated with rocuronium administration. Anesthetics, Sedatives, Hypnotics, Opioids: Enhancement of pharmacodynamic effects. Reduction in dosage of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride or the concomitant medication may be required. ( 7.1 )
