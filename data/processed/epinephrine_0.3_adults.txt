7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Cardiac Glycosides, Diuretics, and Anti-arrhythmics Patients who receive epinephrine while concomitantly taking cardiac glycosides, diuretics, or anti-arrhythmics should be observed carefully for the development of cardiac arrhythmias [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Antidepressants, Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors, Levothyroxine, and Antihistamines The effects of epinephrine may be potentiated by tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, levothyroxine sodium, and certain antihistamines, notably chlorpheniramine, tripelennamine, and diphenhydramine. Beta-Adrenergic Blockers The cardiostimulating and bronchodilating effects of epinephrine are antagonized by beta- adrenergic blocking drugs, such as propranolol. Alpha-Adrenergic Blockers The vasoconstricting and hypertensive effects of epinephrine are antagonized by alpha- adrenergic blocking drugs, such as phentolamine. Ergot Alkaloids Ergot alkaloids may also reverse the pressor effects of epinephrine. Cardiac glycosides or diuretics: observe for development of cardiac arrhythmias.
