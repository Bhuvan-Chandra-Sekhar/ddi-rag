Drug: albendazole

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Dexamethasone: Steady-state trough concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide were about 56% higher when dexamethasone was coadministered with each dose of albendazole. ( 7.1 ) • Praziquantel: In the fed state increased mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of albendazole sulfoxide by about 50% in healthy subjects. ( 7.2 ) • Cimetidine: Increased albendazole sulfoxide concentrations in bile and cystic fluid by about 2-fold in hydatid cyst patients. ( 7.3 ) • Theophylline: Albendazole induces cytochrome P450 1A in human hepatoma cells; therefore, it is recommended that plasma concentrations of theophylline be monitored during and after treatment. ( 5.5 , 7.4 ) 7.1 Dexamethasone Steady-state trough concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide were about 56% higher when 8 mg dexamethasone was co-administered with each dose of albendazole (15 mg/kg/day) in 8 neurocysticercosis patients. 7.2 Praziquantel In the fed state, praziquantel (40 mg/kg) increased mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of albendazole sulfoxide by about 50% in healthy subjects (n = 10) compared with a separate group of subjects (n = 6) given albendazole alone. Mean T max and mean plasma elimination half-life of albendazole sulfoxide were unchanged. The pharmacokinetics of praziquantel were unchanged following co-administration with albendazole (400 mg). 7.3 Cimetidine Albendazole sulfoxide concentrations in bile and cystic fluid were increased (about 2-fold) in hydatid cyst patients treated with cimetidine (10 mg/kg/day) (n = 7) compared with albendazole (20 mg/kg/day) alone (n = 12). Albendazole sulfoxide plasma concentrations were unchanged 4 hours after dosing. 7.4 Theophylline Following a single dose of albendazole (400 mg), the pharmacokinetics of theophylline (aminophylline 5.8 mg/kg infused over 20 minutes) were unchanged. Albendazole induces cytochrome P450 1A in human hepatoma cells; therefore, it is recommended that plasma concentrations of theophylline be monitored during and after treatment.
