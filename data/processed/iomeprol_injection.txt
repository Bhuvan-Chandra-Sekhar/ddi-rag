7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Drug-Drug Interactions Metformin Stop metformin at the time of, or prior to, IOMERVU administration in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast agents. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and reinstitute metformin only after renal function is stable. Metformin can cause lactic acidosis in patients with renal impairment. Iodinated contrast agents appear to increase the risk of metformin-induced lactic acidosis, possibly as a result of worsening renal function. Radioactive Iodine Avoid thyroid therapy or testing using radioactive iodine for up to 6 weeks post IOMERVU. Administration of IOMERVU may interfere with thyroid uptake of radioactive iodine (I-131 and I-123) and decrease therapeutic and diagnostic efficacy. 7.2 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Protein-Bound Iodine Test Do not perform a protein-bound iodine test for at least 16 days following administration of IOMERVU. Iodinated contrast agents, including IOMERVU, will temporarily increase protein-bound iodine in blood. However, thyroid function tests that do not depend on iodine estimations, e.g., triiodothyronine (T 3 ) resin uptake and total or free thyroxine (T 4 ) assays, are not affected.
