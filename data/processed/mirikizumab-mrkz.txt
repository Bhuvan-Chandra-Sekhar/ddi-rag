Drug: mirikizumab-mrkz

=== Drug Interactions ===
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 CYP450 Substrates Increased concentrations of cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, TNFα, IFN) during chronic inflammation associated with certain diseases including Crohn's disease may suppress the formation of CYP450 enzymes. Therapeutic proteins, including mirikizumab-mrkz, that decrease the concentrations of these pro-inflammatory cytokines may increase the formation of CYP450 enzymes resulting in decreased CYP450 substrate exposure. Upon initiation or discontinuation of OMVOH in patients treated with concomitant CYP450 substrates, monitor drug concentrations or other therapeutic parameters, and adjust the dosage of the CYP450 substrate as needed. See the prescribing information of specific CYP450 substrates.
